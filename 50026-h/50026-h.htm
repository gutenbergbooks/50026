<h2>
PREFACE.
</h2>

<hr class="quarter"/>

<p>
<span class="sc">The</span> expectations which have been excited in the
minds of men by the prophecies contained in
Scripture, and the hopes which have been roused
by them, have ever invested Palestine with an
exceptional interest to Biblical students; while its
sacred conditions, historical associations, and existing
remains prove an attraction to crowds of
pilgrims and tourists, who annually flock to the
Holy Land. As, however, the impressions of a
resident and those of a visitor are apt to differ
widely in regard to the conditions which actually
exist there, and the former has opportunities of
researches denied to the latter, I have ventured to
think that a series of letters originally addressed to
the New York ‘Sun,’ and extending over a period
of three years passed in the country, might not be
without interest to the general reader. Many of
these will be found to deal chiefly with archæological
subjects, which must, indeed, form the main
subject of attraction to any one living in the
country, and conversant with its history.
</p>

<p>
A flood of light has been thrown of recent years
<span class="pageno target" title="iv" id="page-iv"></span>
upon its topography, its ancient sites, and the extensive
ruins which still exist to testify to its once
teeming population, by the prolonged and valuable
researches of the “Palestine Exploration Fund” of
London.
</p>

<p>
As, however, these are embodied in volumes so
expensive that they are beyond the reach of the
general public, and are too technical in their character
to suit the taste of the ordinary reader, I have
in many instances endeavoured to popularise them,
availing myself extensively of the information contained
in them and in Captain Conder's excellent
‘Tent Work in Palestine,’ and quoting freely such
passages as tended to the elucidation of the subject
under consideration, more especially with regard
to recent discovery at Jerusalem; but which, as
I was grubbing about, I have not been able to
define as exactly as I should have liked to do had
all the publications been beside me at the moment.
</p>

<p>
The experience and investigation of the last three
years, however, have only served to convince me that
the field of research is far from being exhausted,
and that, should the day ever come when excavation
on a large scale is possible, the Holy Land will yield
treasures of infinite interest and value, alike to the
archæologist and the historian.

<p>
<span class="sc">The</span> chapters which compose this volume originally formed
a series of letters, all of which passed through my hands. I
prepared them for their first appearance in print, and corrected
the proofs afterwards. Finally, it was at my suggestion
and advice that they were gathered together in a book.
</p>

<p>
The deep interest which the land of Palestine possesses
for every thoughtful mind makes us all greedy for fresh
and truthful information, alike concerning its present condition
and the discoveries which new researches add to our
knowledge of the past. From this point of view, many of
the pages which follow are of exceeding importance. Every
Christian will read with deep attention the author's description
of the present state of places connected with momentous
events of New-Testament history; and when, as in the present
instance, the traveller and investigator is one whose
judgment and whose accuracy may be entirely relied upon,
the value of the report surpasses every careless estimate.
</p>

<p>
It is with this feeling that I have urged my friend to
complete his work for publication, and with this feeling
I earnestly commend it to the reader. Nor is its interest
confined to historical and Biblical questions alone; the ethnologist
examining the races of modern Syria, and the philosopher
contemplating the marvellous processes of Asiatic
transformation, will also find here material which will repay
their most careful study.

<a href="#toc-1">A VISIT TO EPHESUS.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Smyrna</span>, Nov. 4, 1882.—There are two ways of doing
Ephesus: you may either go there and, like the Apostle,
“fight with beasts,” in the shape of donkeys and donkey
boys, or you may wear yourself to death under the blazing
sun, alternately scrambling over its rocks, and sinking ankle
deep in the mire of its marshes. In old days it was an easy
two days' ride from Smyrna to Ephesus, the distance being
about fifty miles, but the Smyrna and Aiden Railway speeds
you to the ruins in about two hours now, first through the
romantic little gorge from whose rocky ledge rises the hill
crowned by the ruined castle which overlooks the town, past
a modern and an ancient aqueduct, the latter moss-grown
and picturesque, with its double sets of arches rising one
above the other; through orange and pomegranate groves,
and vineyards yellow and languishing at this season of the
year from the drought; across fertile plains from which the
cereals and corn crops have been removed, and where flocks
of sheep and goats are scattered on distant hill slopes, or
follow in long lines the striking figures of the shepherds in
their broad-shouldered felt coats; past the black tents of the
Yourouks, a nomadic tribe of Turcomans, whose kindred
extend from here to the great wall of China, and who vary
their pastoral operations from one end of Asia to the other
with predatory raids upon unsuspecting travellers; and so
on into a wilder country, where the mountains close in upon
us, and the Western tourist begins to realize that he is really
in Asia, as groups of grunting camels, collected at the little
railway stations, and their wild-looking owners, tell of journeys
into the far interior, and excite a longing in his Cockney
<span class="pageno target" title="2" id="page-2"></span>
breast to emancipate himself from the guidance of Cook,
and plunge into the remote recesses of Asia Minor or Kurdistan.
</p>

<p>
As we approach Ephesus the country again becomes more
fertile, and groves of fig-trees, surpassing all preconceived
notions of the size ordinarily attained by these trees, reveal
one of the principal sources of supply of those “fine fresh
figs” which find their way in such abundance to American
railway cars. As the modern Ephesus is a miserable little
village, containing only a few huts and a very limited supply
of donkeys, the wary traveller will see that his are sent
on from Smyrna beforehand, and will probably find some
consolation for the absence of any competent guide or decent
accommodation, or appliances for seeing the ruins, in
the evidence which this fact affords of the comparative
rareness of tourist visitors.
</p>

<p>
So far from being assailed by shouts for backsheesh, or
bombarded by sellers of sham antiques, or struggled for by
rival guides, one is left entirely to one's own devices on that
desolate little platform. There is an apology for a hotel,
it is true, where cold potted meats are to be obtained, and,
by dint of much searching, a guide, himself an antique, turns
up, but we are very sceptical of his competency. A row of
columns still standing, which once supported an aqueduct,
and the crumbling ruins of a castle on a conical little hill
immediately behind the railway station, suggest the mistaken
idea that these are the ruins of Ephesus. They are
very decent ruins, as ruins go, but the castle is a comparatively
modern Seljük stronghold, and there is nothing certain
about the antiquity of the aqueduct. In exploring the
castle we find that the blocks of stone of old Ephesus have
been built into its walls, and that a still more ancient gateway,
dating from the early period of the Byzantine Empire,
is also largely composed of these antique fragments,
upon which inscriptions are to be deciphered, proving
that they formed part of a Greek temple. So, in the
old mosque of Sultan Selim, which is at the base of the
hill, we find that the magnificent monolith columns of a
still more ancient edifice have been used in the construction
of what must in its day have been a fine specimen
<span class="pageno target" title="3" id="page-3"></span>
of Saracenic architecture; but we have not yet reached the
site of ancient Ephesus. As we stand on the steps of the
old mosque we look over a level and marshy plain, about a
mile broad, which extends to the foot of two rocky hills,
each about two hundred feet high, and divided from each
other by what appears to be a chasm. Behind these is a
higher ridge, backed by the mountain chain. It is on these
two rocky eminences, and on their farther slopes, now hidden
from view, that the ancient Ephesus stood; but the
problem which has for many years vexed antiquarians is the
site, until recently undiscovered, of what gave the town its
chief notoriety.
</p>

<p>
The temple of the great goddess Diana, about a quarter
of the way across the plain, was a wide, low mound, and here
it is that the recent excavations of Mr. Wood have laid bare
one of the most interesting archæological discoveries of
modern times. We eagerly tramp across the mud and over
the corn-stalks of this year's crop to the débris, and, climbing
up it, look down upon a vast depressed area, filled with fragments
of magnificent marble columns, and with carved blocks
on which are inscriptions so fresh that they seem to have
been engraved yesterday, all jumbled together in a hopeless
confusion, but from amid which Mr. Wood, who has had a
force of three hundred men excavating here for the three previous
years, has unearthed many valuable memorials. At the
time of our visit the work was suspended and Mr. Wood was
away, nor was it possible to obtain from the utterly dilapidated
old Arab who called himself a guide, any coherent account
of the last results, beyond the fact that a ship had
come to take them away.
</p>

<p>
I made out one inscription, which was apparently a votive
tablet to the daughter of the Emperor Aurelius Antoninus,
but in most cases, though the engraving, as far as it went, was
clear, the fragments were too small to contain more than a
few words. In places the marble pavement of the temple
was clearly defined, and its size was well worthy the fame
which ranked it among the seven wonders of the world.
From here a long, muddy trudge took us to the base of the
hill, or mount, called Pion, on the flank of which is the cave
of the Seven Sleepers, and attached to it is the well-known
<span class="pageno target" title="4" id="page-4"></span>
legend of the seven young men who went to sleep here, and
awoke, after two hundred years, to find matters so changed
that they were overcome by the shock. When I surmounted
the hill and looked down upon the Stadium, the Agora, the
Odeon, and other ruins, I was conscious of two predominating
sentiments. One was surprise and the other disappointment;
surprise, that one of the most populous and celebrated
cities in the world should have arisen on such a site;
and disappointment, that so little of its magnificence remained.
</p>

<p>
From an architectural point of view there is absolutely
nothing left worth looking at. Lines of broken stone mark
the limits of the principal buildings. The Stadium, which
accommodated 76,000 persons, and one of the theatres, which
accommodated over 56,000, are almost shapeless mounds.
The whole scene is one of most complete desolation, and
we are driven to our imagination to realize what Ephesus
once must have been. In the case of Palmyra and Baalbec
no such effort is necessary; enough is left for us to repeople
without difficulty those splendid solitudes; but in Ephesus
all is savage and dreary in the extreme; deep fissures run into
the rock, which must have formed nearly the centre of the
town; huge boulders of natural stone suggest the wild
character of some portion of the city in its palmiest days.
It is difficult to conceive to what use the citizens devoted
this Mount Pion, with its crags and caverns and fissures.
The lines of the old port are clearly defined by the limits
of a marsh, from which a sluggish stream, formerly a canal,
runs to the sea, about three miles distant, not far from the
debouchure of the Meander. No doubt the mass of the city
surrounded the port, but there is a marvellous lack of débris
in this direction. Between the Temple of Diana and the foot
of Mount Pion there is not a stone, so that the probability is
that the temple was situated amid groves of trees. On the
hill there are stones, or, rather, rocks, enough, but they are
of huge size, and for the most part natural. Of actual city
comparatively few remains still exist. No doubt its columns
and monuments and slabs have supplied materials for the
ornamentation and construction of many cities, and the convenience
of getting to it by sea has materially aided the
<span class="pageno target" title="5" id="page-5"></span>
spoilers. Still, the site of ancient Ephesus affords abundant
material for conjecture, and the more one studies the local
topography the more difficult is it to picture to one's self what
the ancient city was like.
</p>

<p>
From historical association it must ever remain one of the
most interesting spots in the East, while, even from a purely
picturesque point of view, the wild and rugged grandeur
of the scenery amid which it is situated cannot fail to stamp
it upon the memory. As I believe it is intended to continue
excavations, we may hope for still further results, and there
can be no doubt that, when once the obstacles which are
now thrown in the way by the present government, to all
scientific or antiquarian research in Turkey, are removed by
the political changes new pending in the East, a rich field
of exploration will be opened, not at Ephesus alone, but
throughout the little-known ruined cities of Asia Minor.

<h3 id="letter-2">
<a href="#toc-2">THE RUINS OF ATHLIT.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, Nov. 27, 1882.—The more you examine the countries
most frequented by tourists, the more you are perplexed
to comprehend the reasons which decide them to
confine themselves to certain specified routes, arranged apparently
by guides and dragomans, with a view of concealing
from them the principal objects of interest. There is
certainly not one tourist in a hundred who visits the Holy
Land who has ever heard of Athlit, much less been there,
and yet I know of few finer ruins to the west of the Jordan.
To the east the magnificent remains of Jerash, Amman, and
Arak-el Emir are incomparably more interesting, and these,
of course, are also almost ignored by tourists; but that may
be accounted for by the fact that special permission from the
government is required to visit them, while an impression
still exists that the journey is attended with some risk.
Practically this is not the case. It takes a long time to remove
an impression of this kind, and it is the interest of a
large class of persons who live on blackmail to keep it up.
But in the case of Athlit there is no such drawback. Probably
the neglect with which it is treated is due largely to the
fact that no scriptural association attaches to the locality,
and people would rather go to Nazareth than examine the
majestic remains of Roman civilization, or the ruder superstructures
of crusading warfare.
</p>

<p>
The easiest way to reach Athlit is to go to it from Carmel.
As the monastery there is a most modern structure,
about fifty years old, tourists often get as far as that, because
the guide takes them there; but they know nothing
of the mysteries of this sacred mountain, second only to
Sinai, in the estimation of the modern Jew, in the sanctity of
its reputation, and they turn back when, by riding a few
miles down the coast, they would follow a route full of interest.
<span class="pageno target" title="7" id="page-7"></span>
The road traverses a plain about two miles in
width. On the left, the rugged limestone slopes of the
mountain are perforated with caves—in the earliest ages of
Christianity the resorts of hermits, from whom the order
of the Carmelites subsequently arose. Here tradition still
points out the spot where the crusading king, St. Louis of
France, was shipwrecked; and in a gorge of the mountains
may still be seen the foundations of the first monastery, near
a copious spring of clearest water, where the pious monarch
was entertained by the first monks, whom, out of gratitude,
he enabled subsequently to establish themselves upon the
site occupied by the present monastery, and to found an order
which has since become celebrated. Along this line of
coast there is an uninterrupted stretch of sandy beach, upon
which the full force of the Mediterranean breaks in long
lines of rollers, and which would afford an interesting field
of study to the conchologist. Among the most curious
shells are the <i>Murex brandaris</i> and the <i>Murex trunculus</i>, the
prickly shells of the fish which in ancient times yielded the
far-famed Tyrian purple. The Phoenicians obtained the
precious dye from a vessel in the throat of the fish.
</p>

<p>
Instead of following closely the line of coast, I kept near
the base of the Carmel range, reaching in about two hours
from Carmel the village of El Tireh, where the mosque is
part of an old Benedictine monastery, the massive walls of
which have been utilized for religious purposes by the Moslems.
Their worship has had little effect upon the inhabitants,
who are the most notorious thieves and turbulent
rogues in the whole country side. They are rich enough to
indulge their taste for violence with comparative impunity,
as they can always square it with the authorities. Their village
is surrounded with a grove of thirty thousand olive-trees
and the rich plain, extending to the sea, is nearly all
owned by them. Indeed, their evil reputation keeps other
would-be proprietors at a distance. Here the plain begins to
slope backward from the sea, so as to prevent the water
from the mountains from finding a natural outlet, and in
summer the country becomes miasmatic and feverish.
</p>

<p>
From El Tireh, where the inhabitants treated me with
great civility, I crossed the plain, and in an hour more
<span class="pageno target" title="8" id="page-8"></span>
reached an insignificant ruin called El Dustrey, a corruption
of the crusading name “<i>Les Destroits</i>,” or “The Straights,”
so called from a gorge in the limestone ridge, which here separates
the plain from the sea. This very remarkable formation
extends for many miles down the coast. It is a rugged
ridge, varying from twenty to fifty feet in height, and completely
cutting off the sea beach from the fertile plain behind.
Here and there it is split by fissures, through which
the winter torrents find their way to the sea. Skirting this
ridge, we suddenly come upon an artificial cutting, just
wide enough to allow the passage of a chariot. At the entrance,
holes were cut into the rock on both sides, evidently
used in ancient times for closing and barring a passage-way.
The cutting through the rock was from six to eight feet
deep and from sixty to eighty yards in length. The deep
ruts of the chariot-wheels were distinctly visible. Here and
there on the sides steps had been cut leading to the ridge,
which had been fortified.
</p>

<p>
Passing through this cutting, we debouch upon a sandy
plain and a reedy marsh, in which my companion had the
year before killed a wild boar; and here we were in the
presence of a majestic ruin. Immediately facing us was a
fragment of wall, eighty feet high, sixteen feet thick, and
thirty-five yards long. It towers to a height of one hundred
and twenty feet above the sea, and is a conspicuous
landmark. It has been partially stripped of the external
layer of carved stone blocks, and has furnished a quarry to
the inhabitants for some centuries. The wall had evidently
once continued across the base of the promontory upon
which the ancient fortress and town were built. Passing up
a rocky passage and under an archway of comparatively
modern date, and which could still be closed by means of
massive wooden doors, we enter the <i>enceinte</i>, and discover
that the whole promontory is underlaid with huge vaults.
It became also evident that the immense fragment I have described
was the outer wall of a large building, for on the
inside were three ribbed, pointed arches, supported on corbels,
representing on the left a bearded head, on the right a
head shaven on the crown, with curling hair on the sides;
in the centre a <span id="cantilever">cantilever,</span> with three lilies in low relief. As
<span class="pageno target" title="9" id="page-9"></span>
the roof had fallen in, the spring of the arches alone remained.
The whole was constructed of blocks of stone about
three feet long, two feet high, and two feet wide. The promontory
upon which all this solid masonry had been erected
was washed on three sides by the sea. It rose above it precipitously
to a height of about fifty feet. The area was occupied
by a miserable population of possibly a hundred squalid,
half-clad Arabs, whose huts were built among the ruins, thus
preventing any effectual examination of them. It would be
difficult to conceive a greater contrast than is presented by
these wretched fellahin and their burrowing habitations with
the splendour of the edifices and the opulence which must
have characterized the former inhabitants. Here and there we
see a fragment of a granite column, while, when we reach the
brink of the cliff which forms the sea-face of the promontory,
we are again surprised at the stupendous scale of these ancient
works, and of the sea-wall built out upon a ledge of
rocks, exposed to the full fury of the waves, and still standing
to a height of forty or fifty feet.
</p>

<p>
To the right of the promontory, a wall, the base of which
is washed by the waves, is perforated by three arches. It
presents a most picturesque appearance. The southern face
is, however, the most perfect. Here there were evidently
two tiers of walls, one upon the sea-level and one upon the
face of the cliff. Descending into the space between these
I perceived an opening in the side of the rock, and found
myself in a vaulted chamber, which was sufficiently lighted
by apertures in the rock for me to measure it roughly. I estimated
the length at a hundred and twenty feet, the breadth
at thirty-six, and the height at thirty. It so happened
that on the occasion of my visit it was blowing half a gale
of wind from the seaward. The breakers were rolling in
upon the reefs at the base of the promontory, throwing
their spray high up on the ruined walls, and producing an
effect which, with the grandeur of the surroundings, was indescribably
impressive. This chamber was the handsomest
of a series of vaults, several others of which I have explored
under the guidance of the <span id="sheik">sheik,</span> by means of candles and
torches. They are altogether six in number, running round
a rectangle measuring about five hundred feet by three
<span class="pageno target" title="10" id="page-10"></span>
hundred. They are of different sizes, varying from fifty to
three hundred feet in length, from thirty to fifty in breadth,
and from twenty-five to thirty in height.
</p>

<p>
The name of the town which stood here in ancient times
has never been discovered. This is the more singular as it
must evidently have been a place of considerable importance
in the time of the Romans, more probably as a fortress
than as a place of commerce. Its natural advantages for
defence suggest themselves at once. It is important in the
history of the crusades as being the last spot held in Palestine
by the crusaders, who evacuated it in 1291. It was
then destroyed by the Sultan Melik el Ashraf, so that the
most modern parts of the ruins are only six hundred years
old. But the crusaders must have entered into possession
of what was then an ancient fortress in a high state of preservation.
When they took it, it became celebrated as Castellum
Peregrinorum, or the Castle of the Pilgrims. It is
also spoken of in the crusading records as Petra Incisa,
from the fact that it was entered through the cutting in the
rock which I have described. In 1218 the Knights Templars
restored the castle, and constituted it the chief seat of
their order. They found “a number of strange, unknown
coins.” That it was a place of great strength may be inferred
from the fact that it was chosen by such good judges
as the Knights Templars as their chief stronghold; that
it was successfully besieged by one of the sultans of Egypt,
and that it was finally abandoned only because every other
crusading possession in Palestine had succumbed.

<a href="#toc-3">A JEWISH COLONY IN ITS INFANCY.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, Dec. 10.—About sixteen miles to the south of the
projecting point of Carmel, upon which the celebrated monastery
is perched above the sea, there lies a tract of land
which has suddenly acquired an interest owing to the fact
of its having been purchased by the Central Jewish Colonization
Society of Roumania, with a view of placing upon it
emigrants of the Hebrew persuasion who have been compelled
to quit the country of their adoption in consequence of
the legal disabilities to which they are subjected in it, and
who have determined upon making a <i>bona fide</i> attempt to
change the habits of their lives and engage in agricultural
pursuits. I was invited by the local agent in charge of
this enterprise to accompany him on a visit to the new
property, whither he was bound with a view of making arrangements
for housing and placing upon it the first settlers.
Traversing the northern portion of the fertile plain of Sharon,
which extends from Jaffa to Carmel, we enter by a
gorge into the lower spurs of the Carmel range, which is
distant at this point about three miles from the seacoast,
and, winding up a steep path, find ourselves upon a fertile
plateau about four hundred feet above the level of the sea.
Here over a thousand acres of pasture and arable land have
been purchased, on which a small hamlet of half a dozen
native houses and a storehouse belonging to the late proprietor
compose the existing accommodation. This hamlet
is at present occupied by the fellahin who worked the land
for its former owner, and it is proposed to retain their services
as laborers and copartners in the cultivation of the soil
until the new-comers shall have become sufficiently indoctrinated
in the art of agriculture to be able to do for themselves.
</p>

<p>
The experiment of associating Jews and Moslem fellahin
<span class="pageno target" title="12" id="page-12"></span>
in field labor will be an interesting one to watch, and the
preliminary discussions on the subject were more picturesque
than satisfactory. The meeting took place in the
storehouse, where Jews and Arabs squatted promiscuously
amid the heaps of grain, and chaffered over the terms of
their mutual copartnership. It would be difficult to imagine
anything more utterly incongruous than the spectacle
thus presented—the stalwart fellahin, with their wild,
shaggy, black beards, the brass hilts of their pistols projecting
from their waistbands, their tasselled kufeihahs drawn
tightly over their heads and girdled with coarse black
cords, their loose, flowing abbas, and sturdy bare legs and
feet; and the ringleted, effeminate-looking Jews, in caftans
reaching almost to their ankles, as oily as their red or
sandy locks, or the expression of their countenances—the
former inured to hard labor on the burning hillsides of
Palestine, the latter fresh from the Ghetto of some Roumanian
town, unaccustomed to any other description of exercise
than that of their wits, but already quite convinced
that they knew more about agriculture than the people of
the country, full of suspicion of all advice tendered to them,
and animated by a pleasing self-confidence which I fear the
first practical experience will rudely belie. In strange contrast
with these Roumanian Jews was the Arab Jew who
acted as interpreter—a stout, handsome man, in Oriental
garb, as unlike his European coreligionists as the fellahin
themselves. My friend and myself, in the ordinary costume
of the British or American tourist, completed the party.
</p>

<p>
The discussion was protracted beyond midnight—the native
peasants screaming in Arabic, the Roumanian Israelites
endeavoring to outtalk them in German jargon, the
interpreter vainly trying to make himself heard, everybody
at cross-purposes because no one was patient enough to
listen till another had finished, or modest enough to wish to
hear anybody speak but himself. Tired out, I curled myself
on an Arab coverlet, which seemed principally stuffed
with fleas, but sought repose in vain. At last a final rupture
was arrived at, and the fellahin left us, quivering with
indignation at the terms proposed by the new-comers.
Sleep brought better counsel to both sides, and an arrangement
<span class="pageno target" title="13" id="page-13"></span>
was finally arrived at next morning which I am afraid
has only to be put into operation to fail signally. There is
nothing more simple than farming in co-operation with the
fellahin of Palestine if you go the right way to work about
it, and nothing more hopeless if attempted upon a system
to which they are unaccustomed. Probably, after a considerable
loss of time, money, and especially of temper, a more
practical <i>modus operandi</i> will be arrived at. I am bound to
say that I did not discover any aversion on the part of the
Moslem fellahin to the proprietorship by Israelites of their
land, on religious grounds. The only difficulty lay in the
division of labor and of profit, where the owners of the
land were entirely ignorant of agriculture, and therefore dependent
on the co-operation of the peasants, on terms to
be decided between them.
</p>

<p>
I eagerly welcomed the first streaks of dawn to get out
of the close atmosphere in which three had been sleeping besides
myself, and watch the sun rise over the eastern mountains
of Palestine. Ascending to the top of the hill in rear
of the hamlet, I enjoyed a magnificent view. To the south
the eye followed the coast-line to a point where the ruins of
Cæsarea, plainly visible through a glass, bounded the prospect.
From the plain of Sharon, behind it, the hills rose in
swelling undulations, unusually well-wooded for Palestine, to
a height of about two thousand feet, the smoke of numerous
villages mingling with the morning haze. In the extreme
distance to the northeast might be discerned the lofty summits
of Hermon, and in the middle distance the rounded
top of Tabor; while northward, in immediate proximity,
was the range of Carmel, with the Mediterranean bounding
the western horizon. While exploring the newly purchased
tract and examining its agricultural capabilities, I came
upon what were evidently the traces—they could hardly be
called the ruins—of an ancient town. They were on a
rocky hillside, not far from the hamlet. My attention was
first attracted by what had evidently been an old Roman
road, the worn ruts of the chariot-wheels being plainly
visible in the rock. Farther on were the marks of ancient
quarrying, the spaces in the rock, about two feet square,
showing where massive blocks had been hewn. The former
<span class="pageno target" title="14" id="page-14"></span>
owners of the property, observing the interest with which I
examined these traces, took me to a spot where the natives,
in quarrying, had unearthed a piece of wall composed of
stone blocks of the same size, neatly fitted, and approached
by steps carved in the rock. In close proximity to this was
a monument, the meaning of which I was for some time at
a loss to conjecture. It consisted of three sides of a square
excavation hewn out of the solid rock of the hillside, uncovered,
and the depth of which it was difficult to determine,
on account of the débris which had accumulated.
Upon the faces of the chamber thus formed, rows of small
niches had been carved, each niche about a foot high, six
inches wide, and six inches deep. The niches were about
two inches apart, and on one face I counted six rows or
tiers of eighteen niches each. The other sides were not so
perfect, and the rock had broken away in places. I finally
decided that the whole had probably in ancient times been
a vault appropriated to the reception of cinerary urns, but
the matter is one which I must leave to some more experienced
antiquarian than I am to determine definitely.
It is not to be wondered at that this obscure and partially
concealed ruin should have escaped the notice of the Palestine
Exploration Survey.
</p>

<p>
One of the fellahin now told us of a marvel in the neighbourhood.
It was a hole in the rock, to which, by applying
one's ear, one could hear the roar of a mighty river.
Attracted by the prospect of so singular a phenomenon, we
scrambled through the prickly underwood with which the
hillsides are thickly covered, and finally emerged upon a
small valley, at the head of which was an open grassy space,
and near it a table of flat limestone rock. In the centre
of it was an oblong hole, about two inches by three, the
sides of which had been worn smooth by the curious or
superstitious, who had probably visited the spot for ages.
First, the Arab stretched himself at full length, and laid
his ear upon the aperture. I followed suit, and became
conscious not only of a strong draught rushing upward
from subterranean depths, but of a distant roaring sound,
as of a remote Niagara. For a moment I was puzzled,
and the Arab was triumphant, for I had treated his rushing
<span class="pageno target" title="15" id="page-15"></span>
subterranean river with a contemptuous scepticism; yet
here were undeniably the sounds of roaring water. Had
it been a distant gurgle or trickle it would have been explicable,
but it was manifestly impossible that any river
could exist large enough to produce the sounds I heard.
Though the day was perfectly still, the draught upward
was strong enough to blow away the corner of a handkerchief
held over the mouth of the hole. At last I solved
the problem to my own satisfaction. By ascending the hill
on the right the roar of “the loud-voiced neighbouring
ocean,” distant between two and three miles, was distinctly
audible. It had been blowing the day before, and the
rollers were breaking upon the long line of coast. I now
conjectured that the crack in the rock must extend to some
cavern on the seashore, and form a sort of whispering-gallery,
conducting the sound of the breakers with great distinctness
to the top of the hills, but blending them so much
that it seemed at first a continuous rushing noise. This
was an explanation contrary to all tradition, and it was received
by the Arab with incredulity.
</p>

<p>
We now descended once more to the plains, and, crossing
them, reached the village of Tantura, where we arrived
about midday, passing first, however, the ruined fortress of
Muzraá, a massive block of masonry about fifty yards
square, the walls of which are standing to a height of about
ten feet; then turning aside to the old Roman bridge, which
spans in a single high arch the artificial cutting through
the limestone rocks by which the ancients facilitated the
egress of a winter-torrent to the sea. The inhabitants of
Tantura have the reputation of being very bad people, and
three years ago I saw a party of French tourists at Jerusalem
who had been attacked and robbed by them. We
were, however, entertained with the greatest hospitality,
having a levée of the sheik and village notables, and with
difficulty escaping from a banquet which they were preparing
for us. They live in a miserable collection of hovels
amid the almost defaced ruins of the old town, traces of
which, however, are abundant in the neighbourhood. A
lofty fragment of wall on a projecting promontory half a
mile to the north of the town is all that remains of what
<span class="pageno target" title="16" id="page-16"></span>
must have been a castle of grand dimensions. A chain of
small, rocky islets, a few hundred yards from the shore,
forms a sort of natural breakwater, and at very little expense
Tantura could be converted into a good port. As it
is, when the weather is smooth, native craft run in here, and
when once at their anchorage can defy any gale. Tantura,
or Dor, was one of the towns assigned to the half tribe of
Manasseh, but we read that they failed to expel the Canaanites
from it, though when Israel “became strong they
put them to tribute, but did not utterly drive them out.”
</p>

<p>
In the time of the Romans Dor was a mercantile town of
some importance, and, though in the wars of the Diadochi
it was besieged and partly destroyed, the Roman general
Gabinius restored the town and harbor, and its architectural
beauty was such that we read that even in the time of
St. Jerome its ruins were still an object of admiration. Unfortunately,
since the Turkish occupation, all these coast
cities have been used as quarries for the construction of
mosques and fortifications. The marble and granite pillars
and columns, and the carved blocks of stone which
formed the outside casings of the walls, have been carried
away, leaving nothing but the mere skeletons of ruins as
forlorn and desolate as the peasantry who find shelter beneath
them.

<a href="#toc-4">THE TEMPLE SOCIETY.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, Dec. 25.—There are probably not many of your
readers who have ever heard of “The Temple Society,”
and yet it is a religious body numbering over 5000 members,
of whom more than 300 are in America, 1000 in Palestine,
and the remainder scattered over Europe, principally
in Germany, Russia, and Switzerland.
</p>

<p>
The founder of the sect, if sect it can be called, is a certain
Prof. Christophe Hoffman of Würtemberg, who, after
studying at the University of Tübingen about thirty-five
years ago, became a minister of the Lutheran Church and
the principal of the College of Crischona, not far from
Basle, in Switzerland. Here he became known as entertaining
certain theological opinions which soon acquired some
notoriety, as they consisted mainly of a criticism on the action
of the Church with reference to the rationalistic opinions
then becoming prevalent in Germany, and which found
their culminating expression in the writings of the late Dr.
Strauss. Mr. Hoffman, who was an ardent opponent of the
modern and sceptical tendency of German thought, attributed
its growing influence to the feeble opposition offered
to it by the Church, and maintained that its impotency to
arrest the evil arose from the inconsistent practice of its
members with the moral teaching which they professed.
Under the influence of this conviction he abandoned his
charge at Crischona, and with his brothers-in-law founded
a college at “Salon,” not far from Stuttgart, and commenced
an agitation in favour of church reform, both in written
publications and by his personal influence. He was shortly
after elected to the Diet at Frankfort, where he presented a
petition signed by 12,000 persons in favour of reform of the
Lutheran Church.
</p>

<p>
His Biblical studies at this time, especially of the book of
<span class="pageno target" title="18" id="page-18"></span>
Revelations, led him to the conclusion that the period of
the second advent of the Messiah was approaching, but that
Christ could only be received by a Church which had attempted
to embody his moral teaching in daily life; in fact,
that he could only recognize those as his own at his second
coming who had succeeded in practically applying the ethical
code which he had taught when he came first; and he
reproached the Church with failing to inaugurate a social
reconstruction which should render possible a Christ life
in the true acceptation of the term. A doctrine based on
Scripture, and directed against the ecclesiastical system to
which he belonged, naturally brought him into direct collision
with it; and as an interpretation of the New Testament
which strikes at the root of all compromise between profession
and practice must ever be an inconvenient doctrine
to churches which are based upon such compromise, Mr.
Hoffman was summarily expelled, carrying with him, however,
a large body of followers.
</p>

<p>
He now, with a few friends, established a sort of colony
in Würtemberg, where an effort was made to put into daily
practice these high aspirations, and the number of adherents
throughout Europe and in America grew as his views
began to be more widely promulgated and understood. In
1867 the more prominent members of the society held a
meeting, at which it was decided that as the second advent
of the Messiah was expected to occur in Palestine, the Holy
Land was the fitting place for the establishment of the central
point of the Church which was preparing itself to receive
him; that there should be laid the corner-stone of the
new spiritual temple which gave the name of the society;
and that it was the first duty of those who were waiting
for his coming to restore the land to which so many Biblical
promises especially attached. While they considered
that the new kingdom which was to own Christ as its king
was to embrace all those who were prepared to receive him,
in all lands and from among all races, yet the spiritual throne
would be erected in Palestine, and its material restoration
must be a necessary preliminary to its final and ultimate redemption.
It was therefore decided that while the great
majority of the members of the society should remain in
<span class="pageno target" title="19" id="page-19"></span>
Europe to witness for the truth, and to contribute to the
support of the attempt to be made in the Holy Land, a certain
number should proceed thither to establish themselves
in trade and agriculture, and endeavour by the example of
honest industry to elevate the native population and redeem
the land from its present waste and desolate condition.
</p>

<p>
In 1868 Mr. Hoffman, Mr. Hartegg, and some others went
to Constantinople with a view of obtaining a firman from
the Porte, but, failing in this, they proceeded in the following
year to Palestine, where, attracted by the great advantages
of soil, climate, and position offered by the lands at
the foot of Mount Carmel, in the neighbourhood of Haifa,
they fixed upon that locality as the initial point of the enterprise.
Hither shortly flocked agriculturists and handicraftsmen
representing all the important industries, and they
proceeded to lay out their village and build their houses on
the slope between the foot of the mount and the sea, about
a mile to the westward of the native town; but they soon
found that it was impossible to do this without meeting
with the most strenuous opposition on the part of the native
government, and incurring the covert hostility of the
monks who have for seven hundred years enjoyed a spiritual
monopoly of Mount Carmel. As the colonists were almost
without exception men of very moderate means, and believed
in the responsibilities of individual ownership, and
not in any communistic system, they soon found themselves
engaged in a severe and unequal struggle.
</p>

<p>
Ignorant of the language, the country, the methods of
agriculture, the manners and customs of the inhabitants,
who regarded them askance, and unused to the climate, their
faith and powers of endurance were taxed to the utmost.
Not only did they persevere with the most unflinching resolution
at Haifa, but extended their operations to Jaffa, where
at that time a colony of American Adventists, whom some
of your readers may remember, and who had emigrated
there about twenty years ago, was in process of dissolution.
Purchasing the remains of their settlement, a new group of
the Temple Society established themselves there. Since
then two more colonies have been formed, one at Sarona,
about an hour distant from Jaffa, and one in the immediate
<span class="pageno target" title="20" id="page-20"></span>
neighbourhood of Jerusalem, where the leader, Mr. Hoffman,
at present resides.
</p>

<p>
The united population of these four colonies amounts to
about one thousand souls, besides which a few families are also
established at Beyrout and Nazareth. But the largest settlement
is at Haifa, where the society numbers over three hundred.
These now, after fourteen years of vicissitudes, appear
to be entering upon a period of comparative prosperity. They
have not long since completed a twelve years' struggle with
the government for the legalization of the titles to their land,
which the authorities endeavoured to prevent by throwing
every possible obstacle in the way; and while the question
was pending they were compelled to pay their taxes through
the nominal native owners, who assessed the lands at four
times their actual value, putting the balance into their own
pockets. All these difficulties have, however, at last been
surmounted. They now hold their seven hundred acres of
fine arable and vine land free of all encumbrance, and their
well-cultivated fields, trim gardens, and substantial white
stone mansions form a most agreeable and unexpected picture
of civilization upon this semi-barbarous coast.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the influence of three hundred industrious,
simple, honest farmers and artificers has already made its
mark upon the surrounding Arab population, who have
adopted their improved methods of agriculture, and whose
own industries have received a stimulus which bids fair to
make Haifa one of the most prosperous towns on the coast.
Already, since the advent of the Germans, the native population
has largely increased. New stone houses have sprung
up in all directions, and many are in course of construction.
The value of land has increased threefold, and the statistics
of the port show a large increase in the exports and imports.
Perhaps the most remarkable innovation is the introduction
of wheeled vehicles. Fifteen years ago a cart had never
been seen by the inhabitants of Haifa. Omnibuses, owned
and driven by natives, now run four or five times a day between
Haifa and Acre, the capital of the province, distant
about ten miles. It is true that the road is the smooth sea
beach, and that its excellence varies according to the state
of the tide, but in this country carts come before roads, and
<span class="pageno target" title="21" id="page-21"></span>
fortunately its topographical features have been favourable
to the employment of wheeled vehicles. On one side of
Carmel, extending southward, is the plain of Sharon, and
over this one may drive to Jaffa without the necessity of
road-making, so level and free from natural obstacle is it.
On the other we may cross with equal ease the plain of Esdraelon
to the Sea of Tiberias—the experiment having been
made recently—and a road has been constructed to Nazareth,
distant about twenty-two miles. This involved an expenditure
on the part of the colonists of about one thousand dollars.
It is used largely by the Arabs, who have contributed
nothing towards it; but the effect on their minds, as they
drive over it in their own carts, and remember that they
owe both cart and road to the colonists, whom at first they
mistrusted and disliked, is a sound moral investment, and
bears its fruit in many ways.
</p>

<p>
Fifteen years ago no one could venture outside the town
gates to the westward after nightfall, for fear of being waylaid
and robbed by the lawless inhabitants of Tireh—a village
noted for its bad character, about seven miles distant—who
used to come marauding up to the outskirts of Haifa.
Now one can ride and walk with safety in all directions and
at all hours. The Germans have most of them learned to
talk Arabic, and many an Arab that one meets salutes you
with a <i>guten morgen</i> or <i>guten abend</i>, though that is probably
the limit of their linguistic accomplishments; but they respect
and like the colonists, and a good deal of land is now
cultivated on shares by Germans and Arabs, who seem to
arrange their business and agricultural operations to their
mutual satisfaction and in perfect harmony. When we remember
that the Carmelite monks have held the mountain
for seven hundred years, and compare their influence over
the native population with that which these honest Germans
have acquired by simple example during less than fifteen,
we have a striking illustration of the superiority of practice
to preaching, for it should be remarked that any attempt at
proselytism is entirely foreign to their principles. Their
whole effort has been to commend their Christianity by
scrupulous honesty in their dealings, by the harmony and
simplicity of their conduct, and by the active industry of
their lives.

<a href="#toc-5">THE TEMPLE COLONIES IN PALESTINE.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, Jan. 20, 1883.—In a former letter I gave you
a sketch of the origin of the Temple Society and of the
religious motives which have led to the establishment of
four agricultural colonies in the Holy Land by emigrants
from Germany, America, Russia, and Switzerland. As I
have taken up my winter residence in the principal one of
these, situated beneath the shadow of Mount Carmel, some
description of the place and its resources may not be without
interest for your readers. I know of no locality in the
East which offers greater attractions of position, climate,
and association than this spot. Thanks to the efforts of the
colonists, it has become an oasis of civilization in the wilderness
of Oriental barbarism, where the invalid in search of
health, or the tourist on the lookout for a comfortable resting-place
on his travels, will find good accommodation, and
all the necessaries, if not the luxuries, of civilized life.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the whole length of the coast of Palestine
from Tyre to Gaza, only one deep indentation occurs. This
is where it sweeps in a curve around the old fortress of St.
Jean d'Acre, and terminates in the projecting precipice
upon whose ledge the monastery of Carmel is situated.
The bay thus formed is nine miles across from Acre to Carmel,
and about four miles broad. It is bordered the whole
distance by a smooth, hard beach, at the southeastern and
most sheltered extremity of which is situated the town of
Haifa, a modern native town, squeezed in between an overhanging
bluff, on which are the ruins of an old castle, and
the sea. It owes its origin to the arbitrary act of a pacha
who, about a century ago, had rendered himself quasi-independent
of the Porte, and established the seat of his government
at Acre. The population of old Haifa, situated
near the point, having rebelled against him, he punished
<span class="pageno target" title="23" id="page-23"></span>
them by razing it to the ground, and transported the inhabitants
to the edge of the bay under the rock, on which he
put a castle, while he surrounded them with a wall, thus
keeping them prisoners. When he died, his successor was
suppressed, the garrison of the castle was removed, and the
wall was allowed to fall into disrepair. The inhabitants,
who thus were restored to liberty, accustomed to their new
location, began to cultivate the surrounding land and to increase
in wealth and prosperity. Their gardens spread to
the eastward, where the brook Kishon, winding through a
fertile plain, struggles to debouch into the sea, but only
succeeds at certain seasons, owing to the huge sand-bars
which form at its month. These dam it back into small
lakes, which are surrounded by date-groves, thus forming a
most agreeable feature in the scenery. Behind the plain
rises the low, wooded range which is traversed by the road
leading to Nazareth.
</p>

<p>
Though Haifa is comparatively modern, there are some
traces of old ruins in the town, the walls of an old crusading
castle, one or two caverns, which bear marks of having
been inhabited in the rocks immediately behind them, and
the crumbling remains of an archway, dating, probably, from
a period anterior to the crusades. Prior to the arrival of
the colonists of the Temple Society, Haifa was as dirty
as most Arab villages. It is now well paved throughout.
The houses, all constructed of white limestone, quarries of
which abound in the immediate vicinity, give it a clean and
substantial appearance, and contain a bustling and thriving
population of about six thousand inhabitants. Under the
high cactus hedges at its eastern gateway are usually to be
seen, squatting amid sacks of grain, hundreds of camels,
which, attended by wild-looking Arabs, have arrived with
their loads of cereals from the Hauran, on the other side of
the Jordan; for Haifa is gradually becoming one of the
great grain-exporting ports of the country, and one or two
steamers are generally to be seen loading in the harbour.
</p>

<p>
Leaving the town by the western gateway, we ride for about
a mile parallel to the seashore between high cactus hedges,
and suddenly find ourselves apparently transported into the
heart of Europe. Running straight back from the beach
<span class="pageno target" title="24" id="page-24"></span>
for about half a mile, and sloping upward for about a hundred
feet in that distance, to the base of the rocky sides of
Carmel, runs the village street. On each side of it is a path-way,
with a double row of shade-trees, and behind them a
series of white stone houses, of one and two stories, generally
with tiled roofs, each surrounded with its garden, and each
with a text in German engraved over the doorway. There
is another, smaller, parallel street. The whole settlement contains
about sixty houses and three hundred inhabitants. The
English, American, and German vice-consuls are all colonists.
There is a skilled physician, an architect, and engineer in the
colony, an excellent hotel, a school, and meeting-house. The
German government subscribes two thirds and the colonists
one third of the funds required for the school. Some of
the colonists are in business, and have stores in Haifa.
There is also a good store in the colony, where all the most
important trades are represented. There is one wind grist,
and one steam mill, the latter in process of erection. There
is a manufactory of olive-oil soap, the export of which to
America is yearly increasing, and now amounts to 50,000
pounds, and which may be purchased in New York by such
of your readers as have a fancy to wash their hands with
soap direct from the Holy Land, made from the oil of the
olives of Carmel, at F. B. Nichols's, 62 William Street.
There is also a factory for the manufacture of articles from
olive wood.
</p>

<p>
Where Carmel rises abruptly from the upper end of the
street, its rocky sides have been terraced to the summit, and
about a hundred acres are devoted to the cultivation of the
vine. Unfortunately, the varieties which have been imported
from Germany all suffer severely from mildew. I
have therefore sent to the United States for Concords and
some of the hardier American varieties. Along the lower
slopes are thick groves of olives. Scarped along the rugged
mountain-side leads the road to the monastery, distant
about a mile and a half. Situated about five hundred feet
above the sea, it forms a conspicuous object in the landscape
as seen from the colony.
</p>

<p>
The views from the house in which I am living are a
never-ending source of delight. To the east I look over
<span class="pageno target" title="25" id="page-25"></span>
the native town and harbour, with the date-groves and the
plain of the Kishon beyond, backed by the wooded range
which separates it from the plain of Esdraelon. To the
northeast the eye rests on the picturesque outline of the
mountains of northern Palestine, with the rounded top of
Jebel Jernink rising to a height of 4000 feet in the middle
distance, and snow-clad Hermon towering behind to a height
of 9000 feet. Immediately to the north, across the blue
waters of the bay, the white walls and minarets of Acre
rise from the margin of the sea, and beyond it the coastline,
terminating in the white projecting cliff known as
“The Ladder of Tyre.” To the northwestward we look
across a plain about a mile wide, containing the colony
lands, and beyond is the sea horizon, till we turn sufficiently
to meet Carmel bluff and monastery. Behind us the mountain
rises precipitously, throwing us at this time of the year
into shade by three in the afternoon. But even on New-Year's
Day we do not grudge the early absence of the sun, for as
I write the thermometer is standing at 66° in the shade. It
is not, however, the features of the scenery which constitute
its chief beauty, but the wonderful variations of light and
shade, and the atmospheric effects peculiar to the climate,
which invest it with a special charm. On the plain to the
west of the colony, which is bounded on two sides by the
sea, on one by the mountain, and on one by the colony, are
the traces of the old town of Haifa, mentioned in the Talmud,
but not in the Bible, which was besieged and taken
by storm by Tancred, the crusader, in 1100, with a massive
ruin of sea-wall and other remains, from which I have already
dug out fragments of glass and pottery. Behind are
the almost obliterated remains of an old fort, with here and
there a piece of limestone cropping up, bearing the marks of
man's handiwork.
</p>

<p>
Everywhere in Palestine we come upon the evidences of
its antiquity. This plain, now made to yield of its abundance
under the skilful labour of the German colonists, is no
exception, for in the time of the Romans it was the site of
the city of Sycaminum, and in the groovings of rocks upon
which the sea now breaks we see the traces of what were
its baths; in the mounds we find fragments of old masonry
<span class="pageno target" title="26" id="page-26"></span>
and cement; in the depressions we see signs of wells, and
in the rock cuttings of tombs. Only the other day I found,
while digging in the garden for the prosaic purpose of
planting cabbages, a fragment of polished agate which
probably formed a part of the tessellated pavement of some
Roman villa.
</p>

<p>
So the process of decay and reconstruction goes on, and
man is ever trying to rear something new on the ruins of
the old. Let us hope that the sixty or seventy substantial
houses of the new colony are but the outward and visible
signs of that moral edifice which these good people have
come to Palestine to erect, and that from the ruins of a
crumbling ecclesiasticism they may build a temple worthy
the worship of the future.

<a href="#toc-6">EXPLORING MOUNT CARMEL.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, Feb. 7.—It was my fate as a child to live in a
country-house in Scotland, of which one half was some centuries
old, with stone walls several feet thick, and circular
stone steps leading up into a mysterious tower, which was
supposed to be haunted, and in which it was rumoured that
a secret chamber existed, built in the wall, and I remember
perfectly that certain places seemed to sound hollow to blows
of a crowbar, which as I got older, I used to apply to suspected
localities. It is more years than I care to think of
since those days, but I can trace a resemblance to that childish
feeling in the sensations by which I am animated when
I wander over the gloomiest recesses of Carmel alone in
search of caverns.
</p>

<p>
It is called in some ancient Jewish record “the mountain
of the thousand caves,” and has been inhabited from time
immemorial by hermits and religious devotees. Independently
of the Biblical record, we have historical traces of its
holy character. According to the most ancient Persian
traditions, sacred fire burned at the extreme western point
of Carmel. Suetonius speaks of the oracles of the god of Carmel,
and Alexander the Great repeats the saying. The
Syrian city, Ecbatana, alluded to by Pliny, was situated on
this mountain. Pythagoras lived here in retreat for some
time because it had a reputation for superior sanctity, but
Strabo mentions the caves as being haunts of pirates. They
were doubtless used as places of refuge for bad characters,
as well as of seclusion for pious ones. Others were used for
tombs, others for crusaders' sentry-boxes, and now they are
the retreat of flocks and herds, and in some instances storehouses
for grain.
</p>

<p>
Those, however, thus utilized are comparatively few in
number; I believe many to be unknown even to the natives,
<span class="pageno target" title="28" id="page-28"></span>
while others are invested by them with a mysterious character,
and their dimensions are probably exaggerated. I have received
accounts of some, which I hope to visit, which are
said to extend beyond any known exploration, of others
which bear traces of carving and inscriptions, but nothing
can be more uncertain or unsatisfactory than native
accounts upon all matters where definite information is required.
I have tried exploring with guides and exploring
alone, and have been almost as successful one way as the
other.
</p>

<p>
One of my first visits was to a ruin which I had observed
crowning a summit of the range, but which was only visible
from certain points, so shut in was it by the intervening
mountain-tops. I started on horseback, determined to find
my way alone, and struck into a valley where the narrow
path followed a ledge of limestone rock, often not more than
two feet wide. I soon found myself diving into a sombre
gorge, the precipitous sides of which rose abruptly from the
bed of the winter torrent. As I proceeded it became more
and more uncanny; the path was so narrow I could no longer
venture to risk my horse's footing, as a slip would have involved
a fall of at least two hundred feet. My ruin disappeared,
and my gorge seemed to trend away from it, the sun
sank behind the range, and the deep gloom of the solitary
valley, hemmed in on all sides by terraces of limestone, with
here and there a fissure indicating some cavernous recess,
was becoming depressing.
</p>

<p>
I tried to turn, but the ledge was too narrow, so I was
obliged to creep cautiously on in the wrong direction.
I began now rather to fear lest I should meet some one,
not merely because passing would have been impossible,
but because the spot was eminently well calculated for an
act of violence, and, while I always go about unarmed, I find
that my neighbours seldom go out riding alone without
carrying revolvers. The aspect of a wild-looking Arab,
with a gun slung behind him, suddenly turning a corner and
coming straight towards me, was, under these circumstances,
not reassuring. Fortunately, at the moment I saw him I
had reached a spot where a huge rock had been displaced,
and had left a vacant space large enough to enable me to
<span class="pageno target" title="29" id="page-29"></span>
turn comfortably, and I retraced my steps, amply repaid for
my failure in not reaching the ruin, by the solemn grandeur
of the part of the mountain into which I had been penetrating,
and by finding my Arab, when he overtook me, to be a
communicative and harmless individual, who was on his way
home from a cave in which he stored his grain, and which
he assured me I should have reached if I had continued a
few hundred yards farther. Beyond this, he said, the path
led nowhere.
</p>

<p>
My next attempt was made with a friend who knew the
way, and who led me along a corresponding ledge upon the
opposite side of the valley, into a side gorge, which we followed
past a wall of rock, in which were two or three small
caverns, which I entered, the largest not more than twelve
or fourteen feet square, and showing no signs of having been
inhabited. A huge rock detached from the mountain-side,
and hollowed into a sort of gallery, is so celebrated among
the natives that it has a name of its own. Just behind it we
turned to scramble almost straight up the mountain-side,
covered with a scrub composed of camelthorn, odoriferous
thyme, sage, marjoram, and arbutus, and then found we
were at the foot of seven clearly defined terraces, completely
encircling the rounded hill, upon the top of which
stood the crumbling walls of an old fort, and which formed
portions of its defences. On one of these stood a shepherd's
hut, and inside the enclosure made of bushes was the entrance
to a cavern, about thirty yards long, four feet high,
and twenty or thirty feet across. In it, when they were
not out feeding, the shepherd kept his flock of long-eared
goats.
</p>

<p>
Ascending to the ruin, I found it to consist of the remains
of what had evidently been a fort, the walls of which, enclosing
a space of about sixty yards long by forty broad, were
standing to a height of eight or ten feet, and were composed
of blocks of limestone. At one angle a portion of the fortress
had at a later period been converted into a church, the apse,
with its arches, being in a tolerable state of preservation.
The name of this ruin is Rushmea, and according to the
most reliable sources of information to which I have had
access, it was used by Saladin to watch the progress of the
<span class="pageno target" title="30" id="page-30"></span>
siege of Acre when that place was held by the crusaders.
Prior to the crusades and the formation of the order of the
Carmelite monks, the mountain was inhabited by anchorites,
some of whom claimed to have inherited the sacred character
of Elijah and Elisha. For some time seven of them
seem to have divided the claim between them, and one of
them is reported to have lived in a cave at Rushmea, which
is said to contain carving and inscriptions. It was for this cave
I was especially in search; but though I have visited the locality
three times in all, twice with guides, and have found
some seven or eight caves, one of which had a carved limestone
entrance, none of them seemed of sufficient importance
to answer the traditional description. A magnificent view
is obtained from the ruin over the Bay of Acre, with the
town in the distance and the plain of Kishon beneath, and
plainly visible the famous well for the possession of which
Saladin and Richard Cœur de Lion fought. I have visited
this celebrated source, with its massive masonry and crumbling
cistern, in the centre of which there is now a flourishing
fig-tree. During the siege which Haifa then withstood, the
town was completely destroyed, so that the crusading army
had to remain in tents, and here it was that the lion-hearted
king caught that severe fever which gave rise to reports of
his death, and which resulted in his remaining for four weeks
at Haifa to recover his health. That plain is as unhealthy
now as it was then, and the date-groves, which are its most
striking feature, must have existed then, for they are mentioned
in the records of the year 1230, when King Amalrich
II. died of a surfeit of sea-fish, for which the place is celebrated.
</p>

<p>
To return to Rushmea. The whole hill-top is covered with
the traces of remains far anterior to the ruins of crusading
times. Everywhere we come upon the solid limestone foundations
of what must have been large buildings; there are
flights of steps hewn in the rock, large square cuttings from
which blocks have been taken, places where circular holes
have been drilled, grooves, niches, and excavations. On a
plateau about a hundred yards to the west is a series of massive
stone arches in a very fair state of preservation. I
found the elevation of Rushmea, by my aneroid, to be as
<span class="pageno target" title="31" id="page-31"></span>
nearly as possible seven hundred feet above the sea. In a valley
behind it, and a hundred feet below it, are a dozen olive-trees
of immense age, and near them a celebrated spring,
called the Well of Elisha. It is not above twelve feet deep,
and, on descending into it, I found that it was in fact not a
spring, but a subterranean stream which enters a receptacle
formed for it in the rock, from a cave at the side, and from
which it disappears again. Instead of returning from Rushmea
by the way I had come, I pushed up to the head of the
valley in which the spring is situated. On two of the hills
which rise from it I found terraces and the foundations of
stone edifices. Indeed, wherever one wanders in Carmel,
one is apt to stumble upon these substantial records of its
bygone history. As the mountain is about thirteen miles
long and nine miles wide at its southeastern extremity, and
as every valley and hillside and plateau has at one time or
other been inhabited, and as many of these remain still to be
explored for the first time, there is abundant field for investigation,
and it is impossible to take a ride or a scramble in
any direction without coming upon some object of interest.
Nor is it possible to lose one's way when alone, except to a
limited extent, for the nearest hill-top, if you can get to it, is
sure to let you know where you are.
</p>

<p>
Thus leaving Rushmea without a guide, and soon without
a path, I pushed through the scrub, now dismounting and
driving my horse before me, now forcing him, much to his
discomfort, through the prickly bushes. Even at this time
of year the hills are bright with scarlet anemones, and the
delicate pink or white cyclamen, and fragrant with aromatic
odours as we crush through the shrubs. Suddenly I came
upon the foundations of a wall, which I followed for about a
hundred yards, and which was about four feet in thickness.
Near it, half hidden by the bushes, was a circular block of
limestone about five feet high and the same in diameter, in
the centre of which had been drilled a hole. It looked like
the section of some gigantic column such as we see in some
of the temples of Upper Egypt; but it stood alone, and I fail
to imagine its design. Possibly it may have been used for
sacrificial purposes. Shortly after I found myself on a high,
level plateau, where the soil was so excellent, and the rocks
<span class="pageno target" title="32" id="page-32"></span>
had so far disappeared, that it would do admirably for farming
purposes. It seemed to extend over some hundreds
of acres. Formerly, the whole of these fertile tracts of
Carmel were covered with magnificent forests—even in
the memory of man—but of late years the demand for
charcoal has so much increased that the mountain has
been almost completely denuded of trees, and although a
strict order has been issued by the government against the
felling of timber, it still continues, and, thanks to the system
of backsheesh, the export of charcoal from Haifa last year
exceeded that of any previous year. Keeping westward by
my compass I soon after struck a path, and finally dropped
down upon the German colony near Haifa, after a day's ramble
through the most delightful scenery, every step of which
was replete with historical association and antiquarian interest.

<a href="#toc-7">THE VALLEY OF THE MARTYRS.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, Feb. 12.—A more thorough examination of the
rocky hillsides of the Carmel promontory in the vicinity of
the celebrated monastery than I have been hitherto able to
give it, has revealed many spots of interest, and one in particular,
which seems to have escaped the observation of the
Palestine Exploration Fund Survey. About two miles and a
half from Haifa the road to Jaffa passes between a projecting
spur of the range and a mound about a hundred feet
high, which formed the centre of the ancient city of Sycaminum,
and which probably conceals some interesting remains,
which I hope some day to be able to unearth.
</p>

<p>
It projects out into the sea, and on the flat rocks at its
base, over which the waves break in stormy weather, there is
a large circular bath excavated by the Romans, about twenty
feet in circumference, with a channel cut through the
rock, which admits the rising tide. All round this mound
are fragments of columns, carved capitals, and blocks of
polished marble, some of the lightest of which I have carried
away; but it is upon the unknown contents of the
mound itself that my imagination is prone to speculate. On
the left of the road are caverns and rock-cut tombs, some
containing the remains of loculi; and the surface of the
smooth limestone rock leaves traces of ancient steps, and
cuttings, showing that in old times the hand of man had
been actively employed upon it. I had often examined these,
and thought I had reached their limit, when, pushing my
exploration farther up the steep hillside a few days ago,
through the low brush by which it is covered, I unexpectedly
came upon a plateau eight or ten acres in area, and
about two hundred feet above the level of the sea, covered
with the débris of ancient ruins. It was evidently the upper
part of the old city of Sycaminum, and commanded a
<span class="pageno target" title="34" id="page-34"></span>
magnificent view of the coast-line southward, and of what
was formerly the lower town, which has heretofore been
supposed to be all that there was of the city.
</p>

<p>
This upper town, from its cool and delightful position,
was probably the residence of the wealthier inhabitants;
here, too, were fragments of marble columns and carved
capitals, and conspicuous among them two gigantic old
olive millstones, one about eight feet in diameter and two
feet thick, and the other of less diameter, but of more
than three feet in thickness. There were, moreover, many
rock tombs with loculi, the foundations of ancient walls
of immense thickness, and here and there fragments of
the wall itself standing, in one place to a height of about
five feet. But the most interesting find was a triangular
piece of marble, on which was an inscription in a character
which may possibly be ancient Syriac. It is certainly not
Greek, Roman, or Hebrew, though at the first glance I
thought it was the former. Unfortunately, the stone has
been cut since the inscription was engraved, and there are
only a few letters of each word, one below the other, but it
was evidently originally a long one, consisting of many
lines. I also discovered here a cistern, with four circular
apertures; causing myself to be lowered into it, I found
it to be seventy feet long, supported by four pillars hewn
from the living rock, lined with cement, and twenty feet
high, from the débris with which it was partially choked.
Altogether the place is well worth a fuller and more careful
investigation, which I hope to give it.
</p>

<p>
About an hour's ride further south is an interesting spot
called the Valley of the Martyrs, which, though rarely visited,
is well worth an excursion, not merely on account of
its peculiar geological features and its great scenic attractions,
but from the historical associations which attach to it.
It was towards the close of the twelfth century that Father
Brocard was elected vicar-general of the order “of the
Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel,” whose sanctuary
had been long established upon the mountain, though the
members of the order had their homes in its numerous caverns,
resorting to the shrine only for purposes of worship,
while they lived as scattered ascetics in the surrounding
<span class="pageno target" title="35" id="page-35"></span>
valleys. Father Brocard conceived the idea of collecting
them in a monastery, and placing them under certain
fixed regulations, which have ever since been the rules of
the order, and which were sanctioned in <span class="sc small">A.D.</span> 1207 by Saint
Albert, Patriarch at Jerusalem, Pope's Legate, and then resident
at Acre.
</p>

<p>
It was in this gorge, which subsequently became known
as the Valley of the Martyrs, that Father Brocard decided
to build the first monastery, attracted thither, probably, by
its beauty of situation and the copiousness of its springs,
one of which is called after Elijah, as tradition has it that
the inhabitants in his time complained of a lack of water,
and he touched the rock and caused the present stream to
gush forth. It wells up from under the limestone rock, and
flows through a channel cut for it, for a few yards, into a
basin hollowed out of the solid rock, about twelve feet
square and six feet deep; from here it flows down the narrow
gorge, and speedily expends itself in fertilizing some
small gardens of figs, oranges, and pomegranates, which are
wedged in between the rocky hillsides, and are tended by
one or two poor families who live in caves. These gardens
are now claimed by the present monastery, but there seems
much doubt as to the validity of their title.
</p>

<p>
It is safer to dismount after passing this spring, as we
now have to cross the smooth surface of the limestone rock
as we follow the steep path that leads up to the ruin of the
old monastery, the position of which is indicated by the remains
of an enormous wall which nearly reaches across the
gorge, looking from below like some huge dam, and which
must have concealed the monastery itself from public gaze,
except from the hills above. We are now struck by the extraordinary
petrifactions over which we are passing. The
path is worn deep by centuries into the soft limestone, in
the sides of which appear layers of petrified twigs and
branches of the bushes of a bygone period. They are perfectly
white, except where fractures exhibit the black flint
core; but in some instances the form of the branch is perfect
with all its twigs. Passing under the projecting buttress of
the dam-like wall, we suddenly open on a terrace covered
with vines and fruit-trees on one side, and find ourselves at
<span class="pageno target" title="36" id="page-36"></span>
the mouth of a large cave on the other. Entering this, if
we are willing to brave the fleas—for, as it is generally inhabited
by an Arab family, they abound—we find that we
are in a spacious apartment supported by a column of solid
rock, while all around are mangers for horses, cut out of the
stone. Of these we count fourteen, which will give some
idea of the size of the cave. Probably in crusading times
it was a cavalry outpost, affording, from its strong natural
position and proximity to the plain of Sharon, a splendid
point of vantage from which to pounce upon an unsuspecting
enemy.
</p>

<p>
Ascending from the cave by some steps to the terrace, we
come unexpectedly upon a delicious spring overshadowed
by spreading fig-trees, which fills with crystal water a basin
that has been hollowed out of the overhanging rock; from
this it trickles into another stone-cut reservoir, from whence
it is led by a stone channel, hollowed by the monks, to the
monastery itself, one small room of which is still standing.
The rock rises perpendicularly behind, and is scooped here
and there into recesses, which were formerly, doubtless, the
cells of monks, while the cool shade of spreading fruit-trees,
the beauty of the view, the presence of running water, and
the ever-blowing southwest wind, of which they got the
full benefit, must have modified to a considerable extent the
austerities of their existence.
</p>

<p>
There came a day, however, when their peaceful solitude
was rudely disturbed. In 1238 the Saracens came upon
them unexpectedly, and massacred them all, not leaving one
to tell the bloody tale. There seems to be no record of the
actual number who fell victims upon this occasion, but they
must have been very numerous, as the Monastery of St.
Brocard had become a refuge for monks from all parts of
Palestine, who fled hither to escape the persecution to
which they were being subjected in other parts of the country.
Not content with putting them to death, the Saracens
dragged their bodies down to the Spring of Elijah, and flung
them into the square reservoir there, which I have already
described. According to the pious chronicler of this tragic
event, the spring immediately refused to flow, and when the
Christians of Acre, hearing the news, came to bury their
<span class="pageno target" title="37" id="page-37"></span>
coreligionists, they found it dry. When they had completed
their melancholy task, they prayed that the water might
commence to run once more, which it immediately did, and
has never ceased since.
</p>

<p>
The result of this tragedy was the practical expulsion of
the order of the Carmelites from Palestine. The Monastery
of St. Brocard, after its short-lived existence, fell into ruins,
and more than four hundred years elapsed before the order
once more secured a footing on Mount Carmel, and built a
monastery upon it at the end of the promontory, which
served as a hospital for the French soldiers during Napoleon's
occupation of this part of the country. His hurried
evacuation of Palestine involved the destruction of the monastery
and the massacre of all the wounded, to whose memory
a monument has since been erected in the garden attached
to the present edifice. But there can be no doubt
that both for picturesqueness and historical association the
old ruin of the Monastery of Saint Brocard, which altogether
escapes the attention of the tourist and the pilgrim, is far
more interesting than the modern monastery, which is not
fifty years old, and which is about two miles distant from
this old site.
</p>

<p>
On the top of the hill above the ruins of the Monastery of
St. Brocard is a plateau, called the Garden of Elijah, or the
field of melons, which is abundantly strewn with geodes, or
fragments of calcareous stone, having all the shape and appearance
in many cases of petrified fruit, the crystallization
of the centres when they are split open having confirmed this
idea, thus doubtless giving rise to the legend that Elijah on
one occasion, passing through the gardens which were once
situated here, asked the proprietor for some fruit. He replied,
not wishing to comply with the request, that they
were stones, on which the prophet, apparently in a fit of
temper, said, “Well, stones let them remain,” and stones
they have remained ever since. I found some curious specimens
so like small melons that one can well understand
how this fable may have originated among an ignorant population.

<a href="#toc-8">THE ROCK-HEWN CEMETERY OF SHEIK
ABREIK.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Nazareth</span>, Feb. 18.—There is a low range of hills, about
five hundred feet above the sea-level, half-way between
Haifa and Nazareth. It is beautifully timbered with oak-trees,
and cut up into the most charming valleys. Running
almost due north and south, it divides the plain of
Esdraelon from that of Acre. Its southern extremity, terminating
abruptly, forms a small gorge with the Carmel
range, through which the Kishon forces its way to the sea.
It was during a heavy rain-storm a week ago that I approached
the ford of this river from Haifa. It was not
without trepidation, for the stream had been so swollen by
recent rains that communication with the interior had been
interrupted. It was doubtful whether the passage of this
river, which almost dries up in summer, would not involve
a ducking. I therefore prudently requested my companion
to precede me into the yellow, swirling stream, and although
the water came up to our saddle-bags, the horses managed
to get across without losing their footing. Then we galloped
into the oak-woods. The sun broke out from behind
the clouds, and we determined to prosecute our search for
certain caves, of the existence of which we had heard, and
which, owing to the state of the weather, we had almost
decided to abandon.
</p>

<p>
Leaving the high-road to Nazareth to the right, we followed
a path for about half an hour which took us to the
village of Sheik Abreik. It was a miserable collection of
mud hovels, in the muddiest of which dwelt the sheik.
After much palaver and promises of abundant backsheesh
we got him to admit the existence of the caverns of which
we were in search, and persuaded him to be our guide to
them. The first was called by the Arabs “The Cave of
<span class="pageno target" title="39" id="page-39"></span>
Hell.” Its entrance seemed to justify the ill-omened appellation.
It was a steep, sloping tunnel into the bowels of
the earth, just large enough to admit the passage of a man's
body. To slide into this feet foremost after a heavy rain
involved a coating of mud from top to toe. After going
down a few yards we found a chamber in which we could
stand erect. Here we lighted our candle and looked about
us. We found that it was the first of a series of similar
chambers opening one into another. Each contained loculi,
hewn out of the solid rock. The entrances to these chambers
were arched. The pilasters on each side of the entrance
were in some cases ornamented with rude sculptures and
decorated with designs in a yellow pigment. These were in
the form of curves, scrolls, and circles, and were carried over
the roof. Each chamber was about ten feet long by six
feet wide, and on an average contained three tombs or loculi,
one across the chamber, facing the entrance, and one on
each side. There do not seem ever to have been lids to
these stone receptacles for the corpses.
</p>

<p>
The bodies were embalmed, wrapped in cloths, as we read
in Scriptural accounts of burials, notably in that of our
Saviour. “Each in his narrow cell forever laid,” they remained
undisturbed until rude hands, ages afterwards,
“rolled away the stone from the mouth of the cave” and
rifled the contents.
</p>

<p>
Some of the entrances to the chambers had been completely
filled up. In such cases the partition wall of rock
had been broken through. Some of the chambers were
larger than others, and there were two tiers of loculi. In
order to get from one chamber to another it was often necessary
to drag yourself along at full length upon the ground.
In one case the roof had been broken through into a chamber
above, and this probably led to more.
</p>

<p>
I had not time fully to explore this most curious and interesting
spot. Examinations of this sort in the middle of a
long day's ride are very fatiguing. The effort of scrambling
about on all fours, or after the fashion of the serpent,
is very great, and makes you very dirty. In the absence of a
string you are haunted by the idea of not being able to find
your way back, to say nothing of the chance of sticking in
<span class="pageno target" title="40" id="page-40"></span>
one of these narrow passages. Altogether, I entered about
fifteen different chambers, and doubtless the others did not
differ in any important particulars. I am afraid, however,
that I was not the first to discover them, but that this honour
rests with Captain Conder, Royal Engineers, of the Palestine
Exploration Fund. The sheik told us he had once before
guided a foreigner to this locality, and on the next cave
we visited we found the letters R. E. scratched in red paint
on the rock, which under these circumstances can only mean
Royal Engineers.
</p>

<p>
The next cave was a much more comfortable one to examine,
though not nearly so interesting. You could walk about
it comfortably, but there was no ornamentation. The chambers
were larger, but there were only five or six of them.
The stone coffins had, in many instances, been completely
destroyed, but the massive stone columns, or rather blocks,
of living rock which supported the roof were finer than
those in the “Cave of Hell.” Perhaps it owed its more
dilapidated condition to the largeness of its entry, and its
proximity to another huge cave which had evidently in
crusading times been converted into a Christian place of
worship. According to a rough measurement obtained by
pacing it, the nave was seventy feet by thirty, the apse
eighteen by twenty-one, and two apse-shaped transepts
about twenty by eighteen; but these were very much filled
with rubbish. The height of the cave was about thirty
feet. The whole formed a subterranean church, which, in
its perfect condition, when entered from the hillside, must
have presented a very imposing appearance. On the slope
of the hill, not far from this cave, was the carved pedestal
of a granite column, and near it a handsome stone sarcophagus.
</p>

<p>
Instead of going back to the Nazareth road after finishing
our examination of this interesting spot, we made for a
hill on the summit of which we saw some large blocks of
stone betokening ruins. Here we came upon a native excavation,
evidently very recent. Indeed, we heard later that
it had only been abandoned the week before. The natives
occasionally find an unopened tomb, and dig into it
for treasure. It was useless to attempt to disabuse their
<span class="pageno target" title="41" id="page-41"></span>
minds of the idea that we were treasure-hunters. On asking
them what they had found, they said, some red glass
bottles, which they had broken to discover what they contained.
They had also found three jars, one containing
ashes, one earth, and one was empty. These they had also
smashed. It was enough to make one's mouth water to
hear of the destruction of these curiosities so very recently.
I implored them if they found any more not to break them,
but to bring them to me. They laughed, and promised to
do so, saying, at the same time, “They are so very old that
they are not worth anything.” This cave was evidently an
important one, but the natives, finding nothing but the glass
and the jars, had blocked up the entrance again, and I had
to put off the examination of it to some future time. On
the top of the hill there were several sarcophagi, some coffins
hewn out of the living rock on the surface, with the
stone lid at the side. At one place I saw a huge stone lid
about eight feet long, two feet six inches broad at its base,
and the same in height, but coming up to a ridge, which was
evidently still covering the mortal remains which had originally
been placed beneath it. The position of this I have
also marked, and propose, at some future time, to remove it
by gunpowder and see what is below.
</p>

<p>
Had it not been necessary to push on in order to reach
Nazareth before night, I would have lingered longer at
these ruins, which are called Zebda by the natives. They
are worthy of a full examination. The whole rocky summit
of the hill is evidently honeycombed with cave tombs,
many of which had not yet been opened. One of these, some
miles farther on towards Nazareth, especially attracted my
attention. A huge circular stone about two feet in diameter
had been rolled into the carved stone entrance to the
cave, and become tightly wedged. All the efforts of the natives
to remove it, and the marks of such efforts were visible,
had evidently been unavailing. It needed a very small
charge of dynamite to remove the obstacle which had so
successfully resisted the barbarian ingenuity of ages. This
I had arranged to do, but on the day fixed for the purpose
persistent rain disappointed me. However, it is a treat in
store.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="42" id="page-42"></span>
</div>

<p>
The first entrance into one of these old Jewish tomb-caverns
will be an exciting episode, but there is an amount of
suspicion and jealousy on the part of the natives which will
render prudence and circumspection necessary if any attempt
of this sort is to be carried out with success.
</p>

<p>
The whole plain of Esdraelon, on the verge of which this
ruin is situated, as well as part of the hills behind, is now
all owned by one rich firm of Syrian bankers, who draw an
annual income of about $200,000 a year from it. They own
practically about five thousand human beings as well, who
form the population of thirty villages, which are in their
hands. I found no more potent talisman in inducing the
natives to comply with my request; than to mention the
name of “Sursuk,” and imply that I had the honour of his
acquaintance. No despot exercises a more autocratic power
over the liberties or the lives of his subjects than does this
millionaire landed proprietor, who continues annually to
add to his territory till the whole of Galilee seems in danger
of falling into his hands. This part of the country, however,
is at present beginning to attract the attention of
foreigners, and it is to be hoped that before long he may find
rivals in the field who will do more to improve the condition
of the peasantry, and introduce methods of agriculture which
may make them more independent of the money-lenders
who now make their profit by sucking their very life-blood.

<a href="#toc-9">EASTER AMONG THE MELCHITES.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, April 2.—The population of Haifa, which amounts
to about six thousand souls, consists, so far as religious distinctions
are concerned, of Moslems, Roman Catholics—here
called “Latins”—orthodox Greeks, and Greek Catholics,
or Melchites. Of these the latter are the most numerous.
This town may be considered the stronghold of the Melchite
schismatics. They are more influential here than in
any other town in Syria. They compose two thirds of its
entire population. Originally orthodox Greek, they owe
their origin to the missionary efforts of Romish priests and
Jesuits during the last two centuries. As the object has
been to gain partisans, more pains have been taken to obtain
nominal submission to the authority of the pope than
any real change of doctrine or ritual. To this day, Lazarists,
Franciscans, Carmelites, and Jesuits are active in their
efforts to make proselytes to this sect from the orthodox
Greek Church. They allow them to retain their independence
of Rome in many particulars. Thus it is governed
by a patriarch at Damascus who owes allegiance to the
pope. Mass is celebrated in Arabic, they administer the
sacrament in both kinds, they retain their Oriental calendar,
and their priests may be married men, though they may not
marry after ordination. They differ from the orthodox
Greek Church in this, that they take the Romanist view
of the procession of the Holy Spirit. They believe in Purgatory,
they eat fish in Lent, and acknowledge the papal supremacy.
Otherwise they have made no change in passing
from one jurisdiction to the other. As perverts they are
naturally intensely hated by the orthodox Greeks, and when
disturbances take place between Moslems and Christians,
the Greek orthodox are generally to be found siding with
the Moslems against Roman Catholics and Melchites.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="44" id="page-44"></span>
</div>

<p>
To this sect belong some of the wealthiest and most aristocratic
families in Syria. As the ordinary traveller is not
often brought into contact with them, I was not sorry for
the opportunity which my residence furnished me of witnessing
their Easter observances. At midnight on the Saturday
preceding Easter Sunday the festival is announced
by a great consumption of gunpowder. An uproar which
would do credit to a prolonged skirmish lasts till the early
mass. The Melchite church is the largest and most imposing
in Haifa. It is enclosed in a courtyard, round one side
of which runs a balcony. At an early hour on Sunday
morning the whole population turns out in its grandest attire.
The men wear short embroidered jackets, with long
sleeves slashed to the elbow, waistcoats of brilliant colours
and innumerable buttons, bright-coloured sashes, and baggy
trousers. The women are in flowing white robes, which,
drawn over their heads, are held under their chins, only
partially concealing their gay head-dresses sparkling with
coins, and their low-cut vests, gaudy with gold or silver embroidery.
The children are especially subjects of decoration
in costume, and strut about in the brightest of garments,
plentifully ornamented with gold lace and flowers.
</p>

<p>
The narrow street leading to the church is tolerably
crowded as we force our way along until we suddenly meet
a loud-voiced procession, the priests, accompanied by choristers,
keeping up a discordant nasal chant as they march
round the church with the image of the Saviour on a crucifix,
with red and green banners, and with swinging censers,
followed by a miscellaneous crowd, all carrying tapers.
This occurs three times. Afterwards the church square fills
with a noisy crowd of men. The windows and housetops
which command a view of it are filled with female spectators,
who are not allowed to mingle freely with the men.
On the stairs leading to the housetops are clustered the
tawdrily dressed little girls, upon whom no such restriction
is imposed, and then, if I may be pardoned the expression,
the religious fun may be said to begin. It consists in letting
off squibs, crackers, pistols, and guns till the spectator
is almost deafened. The men form themselves in a circle
so large that it fills the whole courtyard, each man throwing
<span class="pageno target" title="45" id="page-45"></span>
his arms right and left round his neighbour's neck, and,
lifting up his voice in a discordant scream, which is supposed
to have some musical connection with the screams of
all his neighbours. It is a dull dance, although noisy. Everybody
makes ungainly steps in time, yelling and leering
at each other in an idiotic manner, and letting off their guns
when impelled to do so by excitement. As far as I could
make out, their songs were rather of an amorous than a religious
character.
</p>

<p>
When this entertainment came to an end a seedy-looking
character entered the arena with an open Bible in his hand.
He proceeded up the stairs to the open balcony, whither he
was followed by the armed crowd who had been dancing.
These ranged themselves right and left beside him, and he
commenced in Arabic to read in a loud voice a chapter from
the Gospel of St. John. When he had read a certain number
of verses he paused, and about a hundred guns went off
in a sort of <i>feu de joie</i>. Then he read on, while his audience
loaded their guns. Then he paused again. They fired again,
and so on all through the chapter, thus emphasizing as it
were the most striking passages by periodical explosions of
gunpowder. When this was over the church bell rang, and
some priests with round, high-crowned hats and locks flowing
over their shoulders made their appearance. I was told
by a Melchite friend that there was no use in going to
church now, as everybody intended to go and get drunk
and pay visits, and indulge in more dancing of a less restrained
character, but that there would be a better mass on
the following day, because the French consul was going to
attend in full uniform, and everybody would be there.
</p>

<p>
This Easter festival lasts three days. The merriment increases
and culminates on the last day, at the expiration of
which everybody has given proof of his religious devotion
by arriving at a blind state of intoxication. When in this
sanctified condition disturbances not unfrequently occur between
these Christian worshippers and the Moslems, in whose
mind Christian religious ceremonial is inseparably connected
with drunken riots and wild orgies. The Caimakam or
Turkish governor of the town, fearing that the strict observance
of Easter according to their custom on the part of
<span class="pageno target" title="46" id="page-46"></span>
the Melchites might lead to these results, issued an order
that on Easter Monday and the day following no firing was
to be allowed, but the Melchites replied to the police officer
charged with enforcing this order, that they had no intention
of obeying it. A serious difficulty might have occurred
were it not for the intervention of the English and French
vice-consuls, who gave the Melchites to understand that the
Turkish authority must be respected. It was a curious illustration
of the state of Turkish administration here that a
Turkish governor should have to appeal to foreign consuls
in order to secure compliance on the part of Turkish subjects
with his own orders. When I attended mass on the
following day there was no firing. With the exception of
the French consul, my friends, and myself, the whole congregation
stood. Three priests officiated at an altar unusually
tawdry, and a group of men and boys kept up a stentorian
nasal chant from first to last. They were accompanied
by an orchestra of two men, each of whom had a
pair of common steel table knives, with which they kept up
a most ear-splitting clatter on the rim of a copper bowl,
that might on ordinary occasions have been used for salad.
The incense-swingers puffed fumes of incense into the faces
of the French consul and myself as being honoured guests,
and a priest brought him an open Bible to kiss, but abstained
from offering it to me—on religious grounds best
known to himself. Then he painted a good many people
with holy water, using a piece of cotton put on the end of
a wire. Then there was the usual procession and elevation
of the Host, and the more devout members prostrated themselves
and kissed the flagstones of the church. The sacrament
was administered, the bread and wine being mixed together
in a silver cup, which was held over an embroidered
napkin stretched between two boys, so that none of the
contents fell to the ground as the priest put the teaspoonful
into the mouths of those who knelt before him. The
women did not seem to need it, as they were all bottled up
in a gallery, and could only see or be seen through a lattice-work.
</p>

<p>
The service came to an end, and the people divided to allow
the French consul, who, with his cocked hat and gold
<span class="pageno target" title="47" id="page-47"></span>
lace, had been the figurehead of the ceremony, to march out
in state. These French consuls are all very pious men in
Syria. The French government, which has been ejecting
monks and nuns and closing religious establishments, and
making laws against religious instruction in France, is very
particular about the religious principles of their representatives
in Syria; as a member of the French government recently
remarked, “Religion is only useful as an article of
export.” Thus, the French consul-general at Beyrout goes
to mass on Easter Sunday with the Roman Catholics. On
Easter Monday he attends mass with the Maronites, and on
Tuesday he worships with the Melchites, thus dividing his
favours equally, and patronizing with great impartiality any
heresies he may happen to come across.
</p>

<p>
As the correct thing among the Melchites after being at
church is to go and “have something to drink,” I followed
the usual custom and paid a visit to my Melchite friend's
family. The ladies of his establishment, in gorgeous attire,
pressed beer and wine and raki, and sweetmeats and cakes
and coffee, upon our enfeebled digestion. We smoked narghilès,
and enlightened our minds upon Melchite manners
and customs. As I passed through the outskirts of the town
on my return home, I came upon the male Melchite population
indulging in their circular dance and their discordant
chants. They continued on the following day, stimulated
by a plentiful indulgence in intoxicating liquors, thus to
glorify God, and to celebrate the resurrection of the Saviour
among men.

<a href="#toc-10">THE JEWISH QUESTION IN PALESTINE.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, April 17.—The exceptional interest which, in the
minds of many people, attaches to the Jewish question in
Palestine must be my excuse for now alluding to it. Although,
in consequence of the strenuous opposition of the
Turkish government, the tide of emigration into the country
has been checked, the desire of the Russian and Roumanian
Jews to escape from the persecution to which they
are subjected in Europe to the Holy Land has in no degree
diminished. On the contrary, colonization societies continue
to be formed and funds collected both in Russia and Roumania,
and the English government has lately remonstrated
with the Porte on the breach of treaty which the prohibition
of Jews to settle in Palestine involves, with what success
remains to be seen. The diplomatic action of the present
government of England is by no means of a robust
kind. Curiously enough, the Russian policy on this interesting
question appears to be undergoing a change. The
Russian government seems disposed to espouse in Turkey
the cause of the race which it oppresses so unmercifully at
home. M. de Nelidoff, the Russian Minister at Constantinople,
has lately addressed a note to the Porte, in which he
complains that the imperial authorities at Jaffa place every
possible obstacle in the way of Jewish pilgrims from Russia
who wish to disembark there in order to proceed to Jerusalem.
The Porte has replied that no restriction whatever
has been placed upon pilgrimages to the Holy City, and that
the Jews, like everybody else, are free to go there. The
Porte, however, draws attention to the imperial decree, recently
published, which strictly prohibits the provincial
authorities from allowing Jews, under any condition whatsoever,
to settle in Palestine, and states that should any
<span class="pageno target" title="49" id="page-49"></span>
Jews, in spite of such express prohibition, seek to establish
themselves there, the law of exclusion would be rigorously
enforced. But all foreigners, of any nationality whatsoever,
have a treaty right to settle in Palestine. The proof of
which is that American and German colonists have established
themselves here; that a society has been formed in
Petersburg for promoting colonization in Palestine by Russian
Christian subjects. A Jew, therefore, who is a Russian
subject has manifestly as good a right to buy a piece
of land in the country and settle upon it as a Christian. At
this moment the Russian Consul-General at Beyrout is
warmly espousing the cause of a Russian Jew colonist, who
forms one of a colony of twenty-five Russian and Roumanian
Jew families who have bought land and settled not far
from the Lake of Tiberias. A Moslem youth wishing to examine
his revolver, which the Jew refused to allow him to
do, the weapon accidentally went off in the struggle, and
mortally wounded the Moslem. The whole Mussulman village
was up in arms, and it was only by the exercise of
much tact on the part of the native Arab Jews that a general
massacre was averted. The young Jew was thrown
into prison, although it was recognized as an accident, and
has been confined in a filthy cell for more than four months.
His case was warmly taken up by the Russian authorities,
and the plea of the Porte is that he had already signed a
paper declaring himself an Ottoman subject. The Russian
officials reply to this that he has since travelled under his
Russian passport, has been recognized as a Russian subject
by the authorities, and that the Arabic paper he signed was
erroneously represented to him as being only a permission
from the local authority to buy land and build a house.
There the matter stands at present, and a warm correspondence
is taking place on the subject. It is significant as
showing the attitude which the Russians are assuming in
the matter. The Russian vice-consul here not long since
brought some Russian immigrant Jews on shore in spite of
the remonstrances of the local authorities. It is evident
that if the Russian government adopts the policy of encouraging
Jewish immigration into Palestine, and of protecting the
immigrants when here, they will have obtained an excellent
<span class="pageno target" title="50" id="page-50"></span>
excuse for political interference in the country. This was
always the danger, and might have been avoided by a more
enlightened and far-sighted policy on the part of the Porte.
Had the Turkish government encouraged Jewish immigration
on the condition of every immigrant becoming a Turkish subject,
they would have added to the population by an industrious
class of people, who would speedily have increased
its material prosperity, while the government might have
so controlled and regulated the immigration and the colonization
that there would have been nothing to fear from it.
By adopting this policy they would avoid possible complications
with foreign powers, while they would at the same
time gain the sympathy of the most enlightened among
them, by affording to a suffering and persecuted race an
asylum where their presence would not only be harmless,
but in the highest degree advantageous to the Turkish province
they had chosen for their home. Of late the prospects
of both the Jewish agricultural colonies which have
been established in Galilee have improved. The assiduity
and perseverance with which, in spite of their inexperience,
of the obstacles thrown in their way, and of the hardships
inseparable from settlement in a new country, they have laboured
on the soil, the progress they have made, and their
prospects for the future, all go to show that under favourable
auspices colonies of this nature cannot but succeed; and
this belief has taken too firm a hold on the Jewish mind
both in Russia and Roumania for it to be lightly abandoned.
At present the pressure on the part of the Roumanian Jews
to emigrate hither is greater than in Russia, where there
has been a lull in the persecution; but unfortunately the
Roumanian government has no diplomatic agents in these
parts, and is indifferent to the fate of the Jews who leave
their country. In former times the British government had
a habit of taking waifs and strays of this description under
its protection. Thus, nearly the whole Jewish community
at Tiberias were originally Russian refugees who emigrated
to Palestine thirty years ago, and applied for British protection,
a privilege which Lord Palmerston promptly granted
them, and to this day they travel with British passports,
and pay five shillings a year to renew their registration,
<span class="pageno target" title="51" id="page-51"></span>
which secures them the protection of the British consul. If
any government were philanthropic enough to adopt a similar
plan now, there would be no difficulty in these poor
Roumanians entering the country and settling here; but
it is a course which naturally involves responsibilities, and
opens a door to possible complications, and in these practical
days people's sufferings, unless something is to be made
out of them, do not furnish a sufficient justification to compensate
for the amount of trouble which they might involve.
Meantime the agricultural enterprise of the Jews in Palestine
has to contend not merely with local opposition, but
with the unaccountable indifference with which their efforts
in this direction are regarded, with a few brilliant exceptions,
by their Western coreligionists. At present the
seven or eight colonies which exist are all composed of
Russian or Roumanian refugees, but the best material for
farmers is to be found among those Jews who have been
bred and born in the country, who are already Turkish subjects,
who speak the language, and are familiar with all the
local conditions, and who are now mendicants, subsisting on
that most pernicious institution, the Haluka, which, while it
is a tax upon the whole Jewish nation outside of Palestine,
is a fruitful source of pillage, contention, and sloth, among
its recipients at Jerusalem and Safed. Out of some seven
thousand Jews resident at the latter place, many are willing
to give up all claim to the Haluka, and establish themselves
as agriculturists, if they could be assisted in the first instance
with the necessary capital. With some of these the
experiment has been tried on a small scale, and they have
proved more successful farmers in every way than the foreign
immigrants, while, as they are natives of the country
and subjects of the government, the latter does not interfere
with their operations, as in the case of the foreigners. Under
these circumstances, it is a thousand pities that Western
Jews do not come to their assistance. They would confer
thereby a twofold benefit upon their race. They would assist
the industry and enterprise of their coreligionists, while
they would undermine that system of religious mendicancy
which is a disgrace to any religion, and they would deprive
thereby their adversaries of the right to say, as
<span class="pageno target" title="52" id="page-52"></span>
they do now, that the success which attends missionary
efforts at proselytism is due chiefly to the fact that Jews
abroad are indifferent to the best interests of such of their
race as have chosen for their home the land of their ancestors.

<h3 id="letter-11">
<a href="#toc-11">“HOLY PLACES” IN GALILEE.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Nazareth</span>, May 1.—Talking the other day to a Franciscan
monk on the prospects of his religion and of the propaganda
for the faith which his order is making in these
parts, he informed me that much depended upon the restoration
of “holy places,” with a view to increasing their importance
and popularity, for practically the most effective
agent for the conversion of infidels is hard cash, and the
increase of expenditure means the increase of converts. Of
course he did not put it in this undisguised language, but it
is distinctly a great pecuniary advantage to a native village
that it should become a centre of religious attraction to pilgrims
and tourists, and that money should be spent in
building churches and monasteries, and otherwise civilizing
remote and outlying localities where the inhabitants would
remain paupers but for the sanctity of the spot upon which
they are fortunate enough to live. Indeed, the latter are
acute enough to understand that they can frequently make
a good thing of it by the exploitation of the rivalries of opposing
creeds, and they cleverly change from one to the
other, when they perceive that it would be to their advantage
to do so. Thus, not long ago, no fewer than a hundred
and twenty of the inhabitants of the village of Kefr
Kenna, situated only a few miles from this place, who belonged
to the orthodox Greek Church, became Roman Catholics,
and as a reward for this proof of their spiritual intelligence
a Franciscan monastery is now in process of construction.
The small village is deriving no little profit in
consequence, to say nothing of the fact that it will draw
pilgrims to visit the historic locality now that they will be
received there by the holy fathers. For both the Greek
and the Catholic churches have hitherto assumed the truth
of a tradition to the effect that Kefr Kenna was the village
<span class="pageno target" title="54" id="page-54"></span>
in which the miracle took place of the conversion of water
into wine—that it is none other, indeed, than the Cana of
Galilee—and they show you the house where the marriage
took place, and the stone water-pots, to prove it. The fact
that it is a matter of great doubt whether it be Cana of
Galilee at all, does not affect the question where religious
faith is concerned, but it seems a pity that the inhabitants
of Kâna el Jelil, commonly called Khurbet Kâna, should
not be put up to the fact that they are possibly the possessors
of the site of the veritable Cana, and may have got
a “holy place” worth thousands of dollars to them if turned
to proper account.
</p>

<p>
I will not trouble my readers with quotations from Scewelf
(<span class="sc small">A.D.</span> 1102), from Marinus Sanutus in the fourteenth century,
from Andrichomius, and from De Vogue and Dr. Robinson
in later times, to prove that this may be so. The fact
that it is admitted by many modern geographers would be
enough for the inhabitants of Khurbet Kâna or for the
Greek Church, if they wished to revenge themselves upon
their Catholic rivals. These latter have made another still
more happy hit quite lately at Sefurieh, the ancient Sepphoris,
distant about three miles from Khurbet Kâna, in
reviving there an almost forgotten “holy place.” The
merit of its discovery seems to rest with Saint Helena, who
made a pilgrimage to Palestine in the fourth century, and
to whose ardent piety, vivid imagination, and energetic
exertions are due most of these traditional spots connected
with the life of Christ which attract pilgrims to the Holy
Land. On what authority she decided that a certain house
in Sepphoris—called in those days Diocæsarea—had been
the abode of Joachim and Anna, the parents of the Virgin,
we are not told, nor how, upon descending into details, she
was further enabled to identify the exact spot upon which
the Virgin received the salutation of the angel; suffice it to
say that the proofs were so convincing to her devout and
august mind that she stamped it with her sanction, and a
cathedral was afterwards erected upon it. In the course of
centuries this edifice crumbled away, the site, curiously
enough, became the manure and rubbish heap of the village,
and under the mound thus formed was buried nearly all
<span class="pageno target" title="55" id="page-55"></span>
that remained of this ancient cathedral. Only the high
arch of the middle aisle and the lower ones of the side aisles
still testified to the modern tourist the ancient proportions
of the edifice.
</p>

<p>
Within the last two years, however, it has occurred to the
Franciscans to make excavations here, with the view of restoring
the ancient cathedral and of renewing its fame as a
holy place, for, to all good Catholics, it must ever be a matter
of the deepest interest to see where the angel saluted
the Virgin, and where her parents lived, and to press their
lips to the ancient stones thus hallowed. Moreover, an influx
of pilgrims to this point will have a threefold effect.
It will bring money to the Franciscan treasury; it will
probably be the means of converting the resident local population,
who have been fanatic Moslems, but who, I was assured
by my ecclesiastical informant, had benefited so much
by the money already spent, that they were only deterred
by fear, and by its not being quite enough, from declaring
their conversion to Christianity to-morrow; and, thirdly, it
would give the French government another holy place to
protect. For it is by the manufacture and protection of
holy places that republican France extends and consolidates
her influence in these parts.
</p>

<p>
It was with a view of seeing what had been done that I
determined to ride over to Sefurieh and from there take a
line of my own through the woods to the Bay of Acre, instead
of returning to the coast by the regular road across
the plain of Esdraelon. Passing Cana and the Christian village
of Reineh, where there is an old well with a sculptured
sarcophagus, we leave to our right a Moslem “holy place,”
called Mashad, where there is a conspicuous wely, or Moslem
shrine. This spot Moslem as well as Christian tradition declares
to be the tomb of Jonah. This tradition is based on
the fact that the prophet is said in the Bible to be of
Gath-Hepher—and this site is pretty well identified with
that of the modern Mashad. There can be little doubt that
these Moslem welies are the modern representatives of those
“high places” which the ancient Jews were so constantly
punished for erecting. They seem, indeed, to differ in no very
marked degree from the “holy places” of the present day.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="56" id="page-56"></span>
</div>

<p>
In an hour more we are galloping up the grassy slope on
the side of which are the mud hovels of the modern population,
whose conversion is so imminent, and the summit of
which is crowned with the picturesque ruins of a crusading
castle, reared upon foundations which are evidently of a
far anterior date. This building is about fifty feet square,
and from the top, which we reach by a dilapidated stair, we
have a magnificent view of the surrounding country, the
Buttauf, formerly the plain of Zebulon, at our feet—at this
time of year a sheet of water—with the high range of the
Jebel Safed behind, and bounding the horizon westward the
sea-line of the Bay of Acre, with the wooded hills, through
which lies my proposed route, intervening. On the side of
the hill near the village is the church in process of restoration,
and in the courtyard which has been recently built in
front of it, where the rubbish mound lately stood, are no
less than a dozen syenite columns, some standing to a height
of twelve or fifteen feet, some prostrate, while their capitals
and entablatures are strewn around. A small chapel has been
fitted up in one of the side aisles, where a priest from
Nazareth comes every Sunday to perform mass to the Arab
and his wife who are left in charge during the week, and
who at present form the whole congregation. The priest
told me that many more handsome columns were in a subterranean
part of the church which had recently been discovered,
but which I could not visit, on account of débris.
He also pointed out the fact that the pillars which supported
the arches were divided into five sections, so built
that they might actually enclose the ancient walls of the
house of Joachim and Anna.
</p>

<p>
What renders this excavation interesting is, that as Sepphoris
was, at the time of Christ, the principal Roman city
and fortress of Galilee, some relics of a date anterior to
that of the church itself may very likely be discovered.
The former importance of the town may be fairly estimated
by the extent of its ancient rock cemetery, which lies about
a mile to the eastward, and which I visited. Here abound
caves with loculi for the dead, sarcophagi, either cut into
the living rock, with their stone lids still upon them, or else
detached and strewn like huge water-troughs over the
<span class="pageno target" title="57" id="page-57"></span>
rocky area, immense cisterns, and rock-cut steps, and a
quarter of a mile distant is a wonderful work of Roman
engineering skill in the shape of an aqueduct many miles
long, which supplied the citadel with water, which it is
supposed continues to Sheik Abreik, a distance of ten
miles, and which here tunnels through the hill for a quarter
of a mile. The roof has in places fallen in, and exposes to
view the canal itself, which is about twenty feet deep, with
sides beautifully cemented. This subterranean aqueduct
has only been recently discovered by the Palestine Exploration
Fund Survey, and is quite unknown to tourists,
though the whole place is well worth visiting.
</p>

<p>
Leaving it with regret, for it required a longer examination
than I was able to give it, I struck off past the lovely
springs of Sefurieh, where a copious stream gushes out full-blown
from its source, to fertilize a valley rich with olive
and fig gardens—a spot celebrated in crusading annals as the
scene of many skirmishes, in some of which Richard Cœur
de Lion distinguished himself so much that his name is still
handed down in tradition among the natives. Crossing
wooded hills, we find that every step opens new surprises
upon us of scenery and of discovery, for these wild forest
recesses have never been thoroughly explored. First we
came upon a group of prostrate columns on which we found
inscriptions, so worn, however, that we were unable to decipher
them, but the native who was with us told us that
the clump of old trees which overhung them bore the name
of “Trees of the Bridegroom,” suggestive of Baal-worship
and a holy place of antiquity. Then we examined two hill-tops
covered with cave tombs, and strewn with massive and
overgrown remains hitherto undiscovered. One of these
was called Jissy and the other Hamitz. The largest of the
caves contained three chambers with loculi. The entrances
were carved. Not far from them I found another group of
columns, and on them managed to trace the letters IMP.
AVR., evidently standing for Imperator Aurelian, which
would make them date from the third century after Christ.
So, winding through rocky, wooded dells, we reached Bethlehem
of Galilee, the modern Beit Lahm, where there were the
remains of an ancient subterranean aqueduct or sarcophagus
<span class="pageno target" title="58" id="page-58"></span>
and the fragment of a column, and on through more glassy
glades, finding our way by instinct, for we were without a
guide; but we had a better chance of stumbling upon undiscovered
ruins this way, and whatever path we followed
was sure in the end to lead us somewhere; moreover, the
view guided us from the hill-tops, and our compass when
we were in the valleys. I quite regretted when at last we
suddenly emerged from these old oak woods—alas! so
rapidly being destroyed by the charcoal burners—and
found ourselves on the edge of a hill overlooking the plain
of the Kishon, across which a rapid ride of three hours
brought us to our journey's end, and completed one of the
most delightful rides it has ever been my fortune to make
in this country.

<a href="#toc-12">PROGRESS IN PALESTINE.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, May 16.—Considering the number of tourists,
both American and English, who annually visit the Holy
Land, I have been much struck with the erroneous impression
which still continues to prevail in regard to its availability
as a field of colonization, and as an opening for foreign
enterprise and capital.
</p>

<p>
For some time past a discussion has been taking place in
the Jewish papers on both sides of the Atlantic, in which the
merits of Palestine from this point of view have been canvassed,
and I can only account for the extraordinary inaccuracies
which have characterized the arguments of the disputants,
by the supposition that they have derived their information
from sources which, owing to the changes which
have taken place in the country during the last few years,
may now be considered obsolete.
</p>

<p>
Readers will be surprised to learn that almost every
acre of the plain of Esdraelon is at this moment in the
highest state of cultivation; that it is perfectly safe to ride
across it unarmed in any direction, as I can testify; that,
so far from plundering and despoiling villages, the few
Bedouins, whose “black tabernacles” are now confined to
the southern margin of the plain, have, in their turn, become
the plundered and despoiled, for they are all reduced
to the position of being subject to inexorable landlords,
who charge them exorbitantly for the land which they occupy,
and for which they pay in hard cash, under penalty
of instant ejection, which is ruthlessly enforced, so that
the inhabitants of the villages, with which the plain is now
dotted, live in perfect security, though more than twenty
years have elapsed since it was predicted that “in ten
years more there will not be an inhabited village in Esdraelon.”
It looks to-day like a huge green lake of waving
<span class="pageno target" title="60" id="page-60"></span>
wheat, with its village-crowned mounds rising from it like
islands; and it presents one of the most striking pictures of
luxuriant fertility which it is possible to conceive.
</p>

<p>
When, therefore, I read the other day, as an argument why
colonies should not be established in this part of Galilee, a
description of the dangers which would attend any such experiment,
I was amazed at the temerity of the assertion. But
as so much attention is just now devoted to the consideration
of the agricultural capabilities of Palestine, I think it only
right that the delusions which evidently continue to exist on
the subject should be dissipated with as little delay as possible.
The fact is, that nearly the whole plain of Esdraelon is divided
between two great proprietors, the Sultan himself, who
has recently acquired a great part of the eastern portion of
it, and the Sursocks, the richest bankers in Syria, who are
resident in Beyrout, and who own nearly all the villages extending
from the foot of the Nazareth hills to the sea.
Some idea of the amount of the grain which is annually
grown on their portion of the plain of Esdraelon alone may
be gathered from the fact that Mr. Sursock himself told me
a few weeks ago that the cost of transporting his last year's
crop to Haifa and Acre amounted to $50,000. This was
said as illustrating the necessity of a railway across the
plain, with a view of cheapening the cost of transport, as,
owing to the Sultan having property here, it has become
desirable in his majesty's interest. A concession has
recently been granted to these Beyrout capitalists for the
purpose of constructing a line which shall connect the Bay
of Acre and the two ports upon it with the great grain-growing
province to the east of the Jordan, called the
Hauran, from which region thousands of camels loaded with
cereals come annually to Acre and Haifa.
</p>

<p>
As I write the engineers are starting to commence the
surveys of this line, which will run right through to the centre
of the plain of Esdraelon, and open up a great extent of
new country lying in the hills behind it, which will now find
an easier access to the sea, while the whole of Galilee will
benefit from so important a means of communication. Indeed,
it is a remarkable fact that while every province in
Turkey has been steadily retrograding during the last few
<span class="pageno target" title="61" id="page-61"></span>
years, Palestine alone has been rapidly developing in agricultural
and material prosperity. In Haifa and its neighbourhood
land has risen threefold in value during the last
five years, while the export and import trade has increased
with a remarkable rapidity, and the population has doubled
within ten years. Indeed, the population of the whole of
Palestine shows an increase during that period, more particularly
owing to immigration within the last year or two.
The consequence is that although, so far as security for life
and property is concerned, there is still much to be desired,
great progress has been made, and with a more energetic
government the country might be rendered as safe as any in
the world.
</p>

<p>
As it is, the Bedouins are being gradually pushed east of
the Jordan, and it is now becoming more and more rare for
an Arab encampment to be seen in the neighbourhood of the
more settled and prosperous part of the country. There are,
of course, villages where the inhabitants have a bad reputation,
and, as a rule in the establishment of new colonies,
proximity to these should be avoided; but fertile lands,
near peaceable villages, removed from all risk of Arab incursion,
and which can be purchased at a low price, abound;
and I know of no more profitable investment of money, were
the government favorable to it, whether by Jew or Gentile,
than is furnished by a judiciously selected tract of this description.
In proof of which may be cited the extraordinary
wealth which has been accumulated by the Sursocks alone,
who now own thousands of acres of the finest land in Palestine,
and who purchase numerous new villages every year.
</p>

<p>
At the same time it must be admitted that, practically, the
purchase of land in this country is attended with many difficulties.
It is either held by villages in a communal manner,
or in very small patches, many of which have several
owners. In the first case the whole village, with its lands,
must be purchased, an operation involving many official
formalities, or the co-proprietors of the small patches have to
agree upon the amount of the purchase-money, and then to
show a clear title and the payment of all arrears of taxes. As
a rule the purchase of any considerable extent of land involves
negotiations extending over several months, and
<span class="pageno target" title="62" id="page-62"></span>
strangers unused to the ways of the country and the methods
by which official routine may be expedited and obstacles removed
are apt to meet with many disappointments. On the
other hand, owing to official corruption, immense tracts of
land fit for cultivation, but which are unoccupied owing to
the sparseness of the population generally, may, through
favouritism and backsheesh, be obtained at an almost nominal
price.
</p>

<p>
The same erroneous impression prevails in regard to the
barrenness of the country, as in regard to its insecurity.
Few travellers see more than the beaten routes, where the
hills happen to be unusually stony and barren; but the extent
of the population which once inhabited the country
furnishes the best evidence of what it is capable of supporting,
and its capacities in this respect have been most forcibly
dwelt upon by the officers engaged in the survey of the
country for the Palestine Exploration Fund, who have enjoyed
unequalled opportunities of judging upon the question.
The fact that the resident Jewish agricultural population of
Galilee alone amounts to over a thousand souls, is probably
one which will astonish Western Jews more than any one
else; but I have verified it by actually visiting myself the
localities in which they are engaged in their farming operations,
and am not giving the number without having arrived
at it upon sure data.
</p>

<p>
There are three prejudices which have operated against
the colonization of Palestine by Jews, and which are all absolutely
unsound, and these are, first, that the Jew cannot become
an agriculturist; secondly, that the country is barren,
and, thirdly, that it is unsafe. The real obstacle in the way
to Palestine colonization does not lie in any of these directions,
but in the fact that the government is most determinedly
opposed to it.

<a href="#toc-13">THE FIRST PALESTINE RAILWAY.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, June 13.—When Thackeray foretold that the day
would come when the scream of the locomotive would awake
the echoes in the Holy Land, and the voice of the conductor
be heard shouting, “Ease her, stop her! Any passengers
for Joppa?” he probably did so very much in the spirit
in which Macaulay prophesied the New-Zealander sitting on
the ruins of London Bridge, as an event in the dim future,
and as a part of some distant impending social revolution;
but the realization of the prediction is becoming imminent.
The preliminary survey has just been completed as far as
the Jordan, of the Hamidié, or Acre and Damascus Railway,
which bids fair to be the first Palestine railway.
</p>

<p>
It is called the Hamidié line because it is named after his
present majesty the Sultan Abdul Hamid, and probably one
reason why the firman has been granted so easily lies in the
fact that it passes through a great extent of property which
he has recently acquired to the east of the plain of Esdraelon.
The concession is held by ten or twelve gentlemen,
some of whom are Moslems and some Christians, but all are
Ottoman subjects resident in Syria. Among the most influential
are the Messrs. Sursock, bankers, who own the
greater part of the plain of Esdraelon, and who have therefore
a large interest in the success of the line. From which
it will appear that this is no speculation of Western promoters
or financiers, but a real, bona-fide enterprise, and one
which is likely to become a large source of profit to the
holders of the concession and to the shareholders, for it will
tap one of the richest grain-producing districts in the East.
</p>

<p>
I have myself ridden over the line for the first twenty
miles, and have just seen the surveying party, who have returned
well satisfied with the facilities which it offers from
an engineering point of view. Starting from Acre, it will
<span class="pageno target" title="64" id="page-64"></span>
follow the curve of the bay for ten miles in a southerly direction
at a distance of about two miles from the beach.
Crossing the Kishon by a sixty-foot bridge, it will turn
east at the junction of a short branch line, two miles long,
at Haifa. Hugging the foot of the Carmel range, so as to
avoid the Kishon marshes, it will pass through the gorge
which separates that mountain from the lower ranges of the
Galilee hills, and debouch into the plain of Esdraelon. This
plain it will traverse in its entire length. The station for
Nazareth will be distant about twelve miles from that town;
there may, however, be a short branch to the foot of the
hills.
</p>

<p>
So far there has only been a rise from the sea-level in
twenty miles of two hundred and ten feet, so that the grade
is imperceptible. It now crosses the watershed, and commences
to descend across the plain of Jezreel to the valley
of the Jordan. Here the Wady Jalud offers an easy incline
as far as Beisan, the ancient Bethshean, and every mile of
the country it has traversed so far is private property, and
fairly cultivated. At Beisan it enters upon a region which
has, partly owing to malaria and partly to its insecurity,
been abandoned to the Arabs, but it is the tract of all others
which the passage of a railway is likely to transfigure,
for the abundance of the water, which is now allowed to
stagnate in marshes, and which causes its unhealthiness, is
destined to attract attention to its great fertility and natural
advantages, which would, with proper drainage, render it
the most profitable region in Palestine. Owing to the elevation
of the springs, which send their copious streams
across the site of Beisan, the rich plain which descends to
the Jordan, five hundred feet below, can be abundantly irrigated.
“In fact,” says Dr. Thomson, describing this
place in his “Land and the Book,” “few spots on earth, and
none in this country, possess greater agricultural and manufacturing
advantages than this valley, and yet it is utterly
desolate.”
</p>

<p>
It needs only a more satisfactory administration on the
part of the government, and the connection of this district
with the sea by rail, to make Beisan an important commercial
and manufacturing centre. All kinds of machinery
<span class="pageno target" title="65" id="page-65"></span>
might be driven at small expense by its abounding brooks,
and then the lovely valley of Jezreel above it, irrigated by
the Jalud, and the Ghor Beisan below, watered in every
part by many fertilizing streams, are capable of sustaining
a little nation in and of themselves. There is a little bit of
engineering required to carry the line down to the valley
of the Jordan, here eight hundred feet below the level of
the sea, which it then follows north as far as the Djisr el-Medjamieh.
Near this ancient Roman bridge of three arches,
which is used to this day by the caravans of camels
which bring the produce of the Hauran to the coast, the
new railway bridge will cross the Jordan, probably the only
one in the world which will have for its neighbour an actual
bridge in use which was built by the Romans, thus, in this
now semi-barbarous country, bringing into close contact an
ancient and a modern civilization. After crossing the Jordan,
the line will still follow the banks of that river to its
junction with the Yarmuk, which it will also cross, and then
traverse a fertile plain of rich alluvium, about five miles
long by four wide, to the base of the ridge which overlooks
the eastern margin of the Sea of Tiberias.
</p>

<p>
This is the extent to which the survey has been completed.
It is not decided whether to rise from the valley by
the shoulder of the ridge which overlooks the Yarmuk, or
to follow the east shore of the Lake of Tiberias to the Wady
Semakh, which offers great advantages for a grade by
which to ascend nearly three thousand feet in about fifteen
miles. This is the toughest bit of engineering on the line,
and is in close proximity to the steep place down which the
swine possessed by devils are said to have rushed into the
sea. Once on the plateau it will traverse the magnificent
pasture-lands of Jaulan, across which I rode four years ago
in the spring, when the numerous streams by which it was
watered were flowing copiously, and the tall, waving grass
reached nearly up to my horse's belly.
</p>

<p>
This rich tract was the one on which it is probable that
Job pastured his flocks and herds—at least, all the local tradition
points to this. It was well populated until comparatively
recent times, but the sedentary inhabitants, the ruins
of whose villages dot the country, were driven out by the
<span class="pageno target" title="66" id="page-66"></span>
Arabs, who now pasture vast herds of cattle upon it, and
droves of horses which are fattened here after their journey
from Mesopotamia previous to being exported to Egypt.
The course of the line across this region has not been definitely
fixed, but it will probably take as southern a direction
as possible, so as to tap the grain-growing country of the
Hauran. There may possibly be a short branch to Mezrib,
which is the principal grain emporium, and one of the most
important halting-places on the great pilgrimage road from
Damascus to Mecca. It is calculated that the transport of
grain alone from this region to the coast will suffice to pay
a large dividend upon the capital required for the construction
of the road, which will be about one hundred and thirty
miles in length. I do not remember the number of tons annually
conveyed on the backs of camels to Acre and Haifa,
but I have seen thousands of these ungainly animals collected
at the gates of both those towns during the season, and
the amount must be something enormous. This does not
include the whole of the Damascus trade, which now finds
its way by the French carriage road across the Lebanon to
Beyrout, and which will all be diverted to the railway, or
the produce of the rich country it traverses between the sea-coast
and the Jordan.
</p>

<p>
The grantees have also secured the right to put steam-tugs
upon the Lake of Tiberias, and under the influence of this
new means of transportation the desolate shores will undergo
transformation. The great plain of Genesareth, across
which I rode a month ago, is now a waste of the most luxuriant
wild vegetation, watered by three fine streams, besides
being well supplied with springs. It was celebrated of old
for the amount and variety of its produce, and I have no
doubt is again destined to be so. The plains in which Bethsaida
and Capernaum stood formerly are all covered with
heavy vegetation which conceals the extensive ruins of the
cities which once adorned them; and there is a fine back
country within easy reach of the lake which will send its
produce to it as soon as means of transportation are provided.
At present there are only half a dozen sailing-boats
on the lake, rather a contrast from the time when Josephus
collected no fewer than two hundred and thirty war-ships
<span class="pageno target" title="67" id="page-67"></span>
with which to attack Tiberius in the war against the Romans;
and the fish with which it abounded in the days of the
miraculous draught are more miraculously numerous than
ever, for fishing as an industry has almost ceased to exist,
and the finny tribe are left undisturbed. There are some
celebrated sulphur baths also on the shores of the lake and
within two miles of the town, which are visited annually by
thousands of patients. I was there during the bathing season,
and found them camped in tents on the margin of the
lake, or sweltering in the fetid atmosphere of the one large
bathing-room, in which a crowd of naked and more or less
cutaneous patients were disporting themselves.
</p>

<p>
The surveying party tell me that they received the greatest
kindness and hospitality from the Arabs in the Jordan
valley, who were of a sedentary tribe, and cultivated the
land, and who looked forward with pleasure to the advent
of a railway, and to the chances of employment which it afforded
them. Indeed, both natives and foreigners are not
a little excited at the prospect which is now being opened
to them, and which promises to be the dawn of a new era of
prosperity for the country.
</p>

<p class="block-quote">
<span class="sc">Note.</span>—Since the above was written, the concession has lapsed in consequence
of difficulties which arose at the last moment in the formation of
the company for carrying out the enterprise; but it is again in process of renewal,
and I have little doubt but that it will be ultimately accomplished.

<a href="#toc-14">SAFED.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, July 10.—Next to Jerusalem, the city most highly
venerated by the Jews in Palestine is Safed. I had occasion
to visit it a few weeks ago on my way to a colony of
Russian and Roumanian Jews which has been established
in the neighbourhood. Perched on the summit of a mountain
nearly three thousand feet high, it is one of the most
picturesquely situated towns in the country; and there is a
tradition to the effect that it was alluded to by Christ as
“the city that is set on a hill, and cannot be hid,” when he
preached the Sermon on the Mount, the mount being supposed
to be one of the Horns of Hattin, a remarkably shaped
hill.
</p>

<p>
The whole of this district is indeed full of romantic
scenery. It is a country of wild gorges and huge precipices,
which escape the attention of the traveller following
the beaten routes, and to most of them associations are attached,
investing them with an interest beyond that of a
mere scenic character. There is, for instance, the Wady
Hammam, where the bluffs are about twelve hundred feet
high, perforated with caves, communicating with each other
by passages concealed in the rock, once the abode of bands
of robbers who lived like eagles in their eyries. Looking up
at these holes in the cliff some seven or eight hundred feet
above me, I tried to picture the terrible battle which was
once fought in mid-air between the denizens of these caves
and the soldiers whom Herod let down the face of the cliff
in baskets to attack them. The desperate nature of the
struggle, as the soldiers strove to make good their foothold
on the edge of the caves, and the frenzy with which the robbers,
who had no loophole of escape, must have defended
themselves as they endeavoured to hurl their assailants from
their baskets, suggested a scene which was quite in keeping
<span class="pageno target" title="69" id="page-69"></span>
with the gloomy character of the surroundings. Some of
the more accessible of these caves have been occupied at a
later period by hermits, and they may have been utilized for
military purposes at the time of the crusades, but they have
never been thoroughly explored.
</p>

<p>
Just before reaching Safed there is a rock called Akhbera,
which rises five hundred feet sheer up from the path, and is
also full of similar caves. Josephus mentions having fortified
it. However prepossessing Safed may look from a distance,
it does not bear a close acquaintance. Down the centre of
every street runs an open sewer, which renders it the most
odoriferous and pestiferous place that it has ever been my
fate to sleep in. The aspect of the population is in keeping
with the general smell. One seems transported into the
ghetto of some Roumanian or Russian town, with a few
Eastern disagreeables added. The population here have not
adopted the Oriental costume as they have at Tiberias, but
wear the high hats, greasy gabardines, and ear-curls of the
Jews of Europe. Instead of Arabic, one hears nothing in
the streets but “jargon,” as the dialect used by the Jews in
eastern Europe is called. The total population of <i>Ashkenazim</i>,
or German Jews, who are hived in this unenviable locality,
is between five and six thousand; besides these there
are about twelve hundred <i>Sephardim</i>, or Spanish Jews, who
wear Oriental costumes, and in the other quarter of the town
from six to seven thousand Moslems, making the total number
of inhabitants about fourteen thousand.
</p>

<p>
As there is nothing approaching to a hotel or boarding-house
in the place, I was of course dependent on the native
hospitality for board and lodging, and thus able to acquire
an insight into the mode of life of rather a curious
section of the human family. The majority of the Jews
here are supported by a charitable fund called the Haluka,
which is subscribed to by pious Jews all over the world as
a sacred duty, for the purpose of providing support to those
of their coreligionists who come here or to Jerusalem to
pass the last years of their lives in devotional exercises, and
to die on the sacred soil. The practical result of this system
is to maintain in idleness and mendicancy a set of useless
bigots, who combine superstitious observance with immoral
<span class="pageno target" title="70" id="page-70"></span>
practice, and who, as a rule, are opposed to every
project which has for its object the real progress of the
Jewish nation. Hence they regard with alarm the establishment
of agricultural colonies, or the inauguration of an era
of any kind of labour by Jews in Palestine. They are bitterly
hostile to schools in which any secular teaching is carried
on, and agree with those Western Jews who consider
that any scheme for developing the material resources of
Palestine by means of Jewish industry is fantastic and
visionary. It is due to the Jewish population of Safed to
say that this spirit does not prevail among the younger
members of it. There are about a hundred young Safed
Jews who actually work as day-labourers on the farms of
Moslems and Christians, and I was informed by one of the
most liberal of the rabbis, the only one, in fact, who was inclined
to promote Jewish agriculture, that about two hundred
families in Safed were desirous of being established on
farms, while several had owned land and cultivated it, and
only abandoned it at last for want of protection against the
extortionate demands of Turkish tax-gatherers. It is true
that most of the Jews at Safed are under the protection of
some European power, but until lately no power has taken
sufficient interest in the race to raise a Jewish question with
the Turkish government. Now that important political interests
are to be subserved by doing so, and the destiny of
Palestine is likely to become a crucial point in the Eastern
question, both Russia and France are seizing every excuse
for interference and complaint, and the questions which are
constantly arising in regard to their Jewish <i>protégés</i>, both in
Tiberias and Safed, are likely to furnish them with the pretexts
they desire.
</p>

<p>
When I was in Safed, Russia was actively espousing the
cause of a young Jew who had accidentally shot a Moslem,
and over whom the Turkish government claimed jurisdiction,
on the ground that, though a Russian, he had repudiated
his allegiance to Russia. As the youth was not of age
at the time, the Russian government still claimed the right
to protect him in Turkey, though it had not exercised this
right in Russia itself, from which country he had been compelled
to flee for his life. As I rode through the village
<span class="pageno target" title="71" id="page-71"></span>
where the accident had taken place, in company with some
Jews, we were pelted by the Moslem population, and, although
the release of the boy is now certain, he will probably
be compelled to leave the country, unless the relatives
of the deceased Moslem can be pacified with the blood-money
that has been offered them.
</p>

<p>
Jauna, which was the name of the village to which I was
bound, was situated about three miles from Safed, in a gorge,
from which, as we descended it, a magnificent view was obtained
over the Jordan valley, with the Lake of Tiberias
lying three thousand feet below us on the right, and the
waters of Merom, or the Lake of Huleh, on the left. The
intervening plain was a rich expanse of country, only waiting
development. The new colony had been established
about eight months, the land having been purchased from
the Moslem villagers, of whom twenty families remained,
who lived on terms of perfect amity with the Jews. These
consisted of twenty-three Roumanian and four Russian
families, numbering in all one hundred and forty souls. The
greater number were hard at work on their potato-patches
when I arrived, and I was pleased to find evidences of thrift
and industry. A row of sixteen neat little houses had been
built, and more were in process of erection. Altogether
this is the most hopeful attempt at a colony which I have
seen in Palestine. The colonists own about a thousand acres
of excellent land, which they were able to purchase at from
three to four dollars an acre. The Russians are establishing
themselves about half a mile from the Roumanians, as Jews
of different nationalities easily get on well together. They
call the colony Rosch Pina, or “Head of the Corner,” the
word occurring in the verse, “The stone which the builders
rejected, the same is become the head of the corner.”

<a href="#toc-15">MEIRON.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, July 20.—One of the most interesting and little-known
spots in Palestine is the famous shrine of Jewish pilgrimage
called Meiron. Hither, in the latter part of the
month of May, Hebrews resort in vast numbers from all
parts, especially of the East, and as many as two thousand
are often encamped there at a time. It is situated in a
wild part of the mountains of central Galilee, on the edge
of the most fertile plateau in the whole district, where the
villages are surrounded by the most luxuriant gardens and
groves, and the peasantry are in a more prosperous condition
than I have seen elsewhere. Meiron itself is a wonderfully
romantic spot; perched at an elevation of twenty five hundred
feet above the sea, upon the northeastern flank of
a high spur of the Jebel Jermuk range, it commands a magnificent
view of the surrounding country, with the town of
Safed, towering on its mountain-top, distant about five miles.
A clear, brawling stream tumbles in a series of small cascades
down the narrow gorge, which expands just here sufficiently
to allow of some orchards of apricots, figs, and
pomegranates; and near a spreading weeping-willow there
is a picturesque old flour-mill, which turns to advantage so
unusual a supply of water-power. A hundred yards or so
above it is the spot sacred to Jewish devotees. A large, oblong
courtyard, around which runs a broad stone balcony,
upon which open chambers crowned with domes, marks the
site of the burial-places of some of the most celebrated rabbis
of Jewish history, and forms a sort of caravansary for
the pilgrims. It was not the moment of the pilgrimage at
the time of my visit, and I had a choice of chambers. Two
of these had been fitted up most comfortably for my benefit,
with beds and tables, by the Safed Jews who accompanied
me, and who did the honours of the place. It was
<span class="pageno target" title="73" id="page-73"></span>
no doubt the sacredness of the tombs at Meiron which was
the cause of Safed being constituted a Jewish colony and
a holy city. Here are situated the tombs of the Rabbi
<span id="Jochanan">Jochanan</span> Sandelar, of the celebrated Rabbi Simeon ben
Jochai, the reputed author of the book of the Sohar, and
the Father of the Cabalists. Here repose the remains of his
son, the Rabbi Eleazer; but more celebrated than all are
the sepulchres of the great saints and doctors, Shammai
and Hillel. The thirty-six pupils of the latter were buried
with him. He founded a school of morals immediately
prior to the birth of Christ; and, indeed, it is maintained
by Jews that all the ethics of Christianity are to be
found in the teaching of Hillel, to which Christ simply
gave a more forcible expression than it had hitherto received.
</p>

<p>
Of all the tombs that of Hillel is the most remarkable. It
is a huge cavern on the steep hillside, situated about half-way
between the Courtyard of Shrines above, and the stream below.
We first enter a chamber with loculi hewn out of the solid
rock on each side. Passing through a doorway cut in the
rock, we enter a chamber eighteen feet by twenty-five, with
seven loculi in recess on the right, and the same number on
the left, while facing us is a recess eighteen feet deep and
seven wide, containing four sarcophagi hewn out of the rock.
On each side of this recess is a smaller one, each containing
four loculi. Most of them are covered by stone lids with
raised corners, making in all thirty-six rock tombs in this
one cave. The rocks all around are much cut in places into
steps, cisterns, and olive-presses. There are also three dolmens
on the north side of Meiron; they are not far apart,
and are quite distinct, though of small dimensions; there are
no traces or marks of any kind on the stones. In the shrine
above these are chambers which are pointed out as traditional
tombs. Near one of these was the synagogue, in which,
when I visited it, there were an old man and his son engaged
in their devotions. The old man had never left the room
day or night for seven years, having lived the whole of that
time on one meal a day of bread and water, while he slept
on a mat on the stones. He had thus become invested with
the odour of sanctity in the eyes of my Jewish companions.
<span class="pageno target" title="74" id="page-74"></span>
His son, a boy of fifteen, was rapidly praying himself into
the state of imbecility at which his venerable parent, by dint
of swaying his body to and fro, and his unceasing chanting,
had already arrived. He reminded me of the Buddhist hermits
whom I have seen in China on their way to Nirvana,
and was a sight more painful than edifying. At the corners
of the courtyard are stone erections like fonts, and some of
these are also near the rock tombs; these, when the Jewish
festival of “the burning” takes place, are filled with oil,
which is set on fire, and rich Jews, desirous of showing their
devotion, offer to the flames the most costly articles in their
possession. The richest shawls, scarfs, handkerchiefs, and the
rarest books are dipped in oil and consumed, and when any
article of special value is burned, the spectators, who are
already intoxicated with wine and excitement, burst forth
with frantic plaudits of delight. Such was the account given
to me by eye-witnesses, but possibly next year I may be able
to give you a description of this unique and little-known festival
from personal observation.
</p>

<p>
About fifty yards higher up the hill is one of the most
interesting Jewish ruins existing in Palestine. It is the remains
of a synagogue, which, according to Jewish tradition,
dates from fifty years after the destruction of Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
It was about this time, or a little later, that the Jews presented
the extraordinary spectacle of two regular and organized
communities, one under a sort of spiritual head, the
Patriarch of Tiberias, comprehending all of Israelitish descent
who inhabited the Roman Empire; the other under
the Prince of the Captivity, to whom all the Eastern Jews
paid their allegiance. The Romans recognized the Patriarchship
of Tiberias, granted it special privileges, and the Jewish
colony round Tiberias under its auspices became very
powerful. Schools of Talmudic learning were established,
and the most celebrated rabbis wrote, and, in fact, stamped
with their learning the Judaism which has felt their influence
to the present day. Then it was that Meiron became their
place of burial, and that the largest and most ancient synagogue
of which we have any traces was built at Meiron.
The site of the synagogue was chosen on the eastern side of
a rocky mound, and the western side and floor were excavated
<span class="pageno target" title="75" id="page-75"></span>
out of the solid rock. The whole of the area is ninety feet
by fifty. Pieces of columns are lying about, with pedestals
and capitals, but many of the finest fragments have rolled
down the eastern slope. The edifice fronted the south, and
here the façade remains, with a fine portal of large hewn
blocks of stone, and a side door. Some of the stones are
four and a half feet long by two and a half thick. The
portal is ten and a half feet high by five and a half
wide. Its side-posts are each of a single stone elaborately
sculptured. The sculptured lintel projects somewhat above
the side-posts, but I could see nothing of the Hebrew inscription
which some of the old writers mention as being
over the door. The centre stone was shaken out of its place
by the earthquake of 1837. Altogether, the situation and general
aspect of this singular ruin, projecting as it does out of
the overhanging solid rock, is full of picturesque as well as
of historical interest. Meiron is probably mentioned by
Josephus as Meroth, a place fortified by him in Upper Galilee.
Dr. Thomson identifies it with the Meroz, so bitterly
cursed by Deborah because the inhabitants would not join
the expedition of Barak. And, in confirmation of this, there
is a fountain near Meiron called to this day by the Jews
Deborah's fountain, but the Sephardim rabbi, who was my
guide, philosopher, and friend at Meiron, identified it with
Shimrom-Meron, whose king was one of the thirty-one
mentioned in the Book of Joshua as having been smitten by
him on entering Canaan.
</p>

<p>
A great part of the village belonged to the rabbi, and,
with a view of encouraging agriculture among his coreligionists,
he had put six Jewish families from Morocco on
the land, who were accustomed to farming, and were doing
well. Besides these there were twelve Moslem families,
which completed the population of the village. I was much
struck by the good-feeling which existed between them and
the Jews, the sheik whom I visited speaking in the highest
terms of the latter, as being hard-working and excellent agriculturists.
Indeed, in walking over the village lands,
those which were cultivated by Jewish labour compared favourably
with the crops of the Fellahin. Altogether, I was
so much attracted by Meiron and its neighbourhood, which
<span class="pageno target" title="76" id="page-76"></span>
is full of interesting remains that have not yet been thoroughly
examined, from an antiquarian point of view, that I propose
paying it another visit.
</p>

<p>
Behind Meiron rises Jebel Jermuk, the highest mountain
in western Palestine. I scrambled up it one day, finding myself
as I did so in the midst of the wildest scenery to the
west of the Jordan. Here villages were few and far between.
Nothing was to be seen but rocky gorges and
wild hillsides, trackless, excepting where the goats follow
each other in search of herbage, but with a grand and savage
beauty which it is difficult to reconcile with the idea
that they ever supported a large population. Probably,
even in the most flourishing days of Palestine, these highlands
were always its wildest parts, and there are comparatively
few ancient sites or traces of ruins in the remote recesses
of these mountains. Jebel Jermuk rears its rounded
summit to a height of four thousand feet above the sea-level,
and about three hundred feet below the top are the ruins of
a village which was abandoned about twenty years ago by
twelve Jewish families, which formed its entire population,
and who were all cultivators of the soil and owners of flocks
and herds. In those days it was the highest inhabited spot
in Palestine, and it is wonderful to think its pure mountain
air should not have protected the inhabitants against cholera,
which was then decimating the country. So far from such
being the case, nearly the whole male population was carried
off, and the village was abandoned, and finally became
the property of a Druse village about three miles distant.
The stone walls of the houses are still standing, and
there is a well of delicious water, shaded by trees, making
the spot altogether a desirable retreat from the summer heats
and a healthy locality for a colony, if it were not so inaccessible.
These mountains are not frequented by Bedouin
Arabs, and need nothing but roads and cultivation to make
many now barren spots fertile and profitable. The more one
travels over the less-frequented parts of the country, the
more one is struck with the extent of its undeveloped resources
and with the possible future which is in store for it.

<h3 id="letter-16">
<a href="#toc-16">THE FEAST OF ST. ELIAS.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, July 31.—The greatest religions festival of the
year in these parts takes place on the 20th of July at the
Monastery of Mount Carmel, and is called the Feast of St.
Elias. It does not rank in the Roman Catholic Church
generally as one of the highest importance, but among the
Maronites, Melchites, and the Latin Oriental Church, as
well as among the Carmelites themselves, it is par excellence
the great annual ecclesiastical event. From all parts of Palestine
worshippers of all ranks flock to the sacred grotto, and
on the evening before the saint's day as many as five or six
thousand souls are often assembled on the rugged promontory
and in the enclosures surrounding the monastery.
Hither I repaired about six o'clock on the evening of the
19th, and sipped coffee, smoked cigarettes, and chatted with
the reverend fathers, while I looked out of the iron-barred
windows on the multitude assembling beneath them. It
was composed for the most part of vendors of fruit, sweetmeats,
and refreshments of all sorts, who were establishing
their stalls for the night in sheltered nooks, for the feast
begins at midnight, and is carried on till nine o'clock next
day, being, in fact, a species of religious orgy, which appears
to have great fascination for the native Christian
mind. It must be admitted that devotions which consist
chiefly in dancing and drinking, with an occasional free
fight, all through the small hours of the morning, are religious
exercises of a kind not unlikely to attract the country
people, who go in for a sort of holy spree on a scale of
large proportions. This year, however, a general panic
which pervaded the country in consequence of the cholera
in Egypt reduced the numbers materially, especially of the
Fellahin, among whom all kinds of absurd rumours were
prevalent that the disease had spread to Haifa, and that the
<span class="pageno target" title="78" id="page-78"></span>
monastery itself was in quarantine. After watching the
picturesque arrivals for some time, I declined an invitation
to spend the night in the monastery, and determined to return
next morning at five o'clock, when I was assured that
the fun would be fast and furious.
</p>

<p>
As I approached at that hour my expectations were excited
by the reports of the discharge of pistols and guns,
and the sounds of the discordant chorus-chanting which
forms the usual accompaniment to the native dances. Passing
under the archway and entering the large courtyard of
the monastery, I found it nearly full of excited groups in
large circles, their arms clasped around each other's necks,
swaying their bodies to and fro, and keeping time with
their feet to their songs, while they occasionally waved their
arms aloft and fired in the air. This is the regular Syrian
dance of the towns, and it is sufficiently monotonous. The
Fellahin, however, have a far more picturesque performance,
in which the girls, in bright-coloured garments, join,
dancing singly, or in twos and threes. Of these, unfortunately,
there were very few. No doubt it was in consequence
of the small attendance that there had not been so much
drinking as usual, and I only saw one man captured by half
a dozen Turkish soldiers, who must have a curious idea of
Christian devotions, for an improper use of his fist.
</p>

<p>
About this time the guest-chambers and corridors of the
monastery—where families of the better class who had come
from Acre, Tyre, Nazareth, Jaffa, and other towns had
passed the night, in the lodging provided for them—began
to disgorge, and the variety of costume displayed by the
shouting, singing, and dancing multitude formed a scene
sufficiently picturesque and animated. Sometimes processions
are formed, where offerings are made to the miracle-working
statue of Notre Dame de Mont Carmel, in return
for a child that has been prayed for, or a sick person who
has been healed, but on this occasion her protection did not
seem to have been invoked, or, at all events, there was no
public display of gratitude. There is a large terrace in
front of the monastery, and here a dozen horsemen or so
were throwing the djerrid and exhibiting their equestrian
skill, much to the detriment of the unfortunate animals they
<span class="pageno target" title="79" id="page-79"></span>
bestrode, whose flanks were bleeding profusely from the
pointed angles of the iron stirrups which serve as spurs, and
from the cruel bits by which, when going at full speed, they
were jerked back upon their haunches.
</p>

<p>
While all this was going on outside, mass was being performed
in the church for those who wished to vary the entertainment.
This is a spacious, vaulted building in the form of
a Greek cross, with a fine-toned organ in one transept, and a
statue of the miraculous Lady of Mount Carmel, between four
Corinthian columns, seated on a sort of throne in a richly
decorated dress of white satin, in the other. Both the Virgin
and the Infant in her arms had golden crowns on their
heads, the result of a miracle, for when the Frère Jean Baptiste
undertook the reconstruction of the monastery fifty
years ago, he intrusted the carving of the statue to Caraventa,
a sculptor of Genoa, and, not having money enough to
buy her a crown suitable to her position, procured her one
of silver, and one of copper gilt for the Child, saying as he
did so, “You will know how to procure yourself a better
one;” and this she achieved shortly after at Naples, where
a rich nobleman presented her with two in return for a miraculous
cure of which he was the subject. There is a book
sold in the monastery containing a list of the miracles that
have been performed by this statue, which was gazed upon
with the greatest awe and veneration by the country people.
They prostrate themselves before her, touching the ground
with their foreheads, and offering up their supplications
after a fashion that would shock an enlightened Buddhist
by the superstition and credulity thus suggested. On each
side of the figure are two altars, one dedicated to St. Jean
Baptiste, and the other to St. Simon Stock, an Englishman,
who was made Prior-General of the Order of Carmelites
in 1245, and who in his day did more than any other to
increase their renown. On the right of this is the statue of
Elijah slaying a prophet of Baal, which was sculptured at
Barcelona by Dom Amédéo. The prophet has got his false
rival on the ground between his feet, and, with uplifted
sword, is in the act of cutting his head off. He is hung
round with votive offerings, and worshippers crowd around
to touch some part of the statue, and then kiss the finger
<span class="pageno target" title="80" id="page-80"></span>
that has touched it. On a table in front a monk was selling
engravings to the worshippers. I bought one of these, representing
Elijah sending Elisha to look for the sign of rain.
In the distance is the small cloud, no bigger than a man's
hand, and emerging from it is the figure of the Virgin and
Child, for the Roman Catholic tradition has it that in this
cloud was revealed to the prophet the dogma of the immaculate
conception, in which he was a firm believer from that
time forward.
</p>

<p>
Descending a few rock-cut steps close to this image, we
find ourselves in the cave of Elijah, a small grotto about ten
feet by fifteen, at one end of which is an altar, which the
devotees firmly believe is the actual rock that he used as
his bed. Here a priest was performing mass. The body of
the church was full of devotees, for the most part women
in white burnooses, who squatted on the ground, and seemed
principally engaged in suckling their babies.
</p>

<p>
The monastery derives a considerable revenue from these
celebrations, as in good seasons votive offerings to a large
value are brought; but the chief source of its wealth is derived
from the sale of indulgences, or at least what virtually
amounts to this. By these means it exercises a very powerful
moral as well as financial influence all through the country,
and as the Christian population, which is subject to it, is very
large in proportion to the Moslem in the neighbourhood, and
as it is under the exclusive protectorate of France, this influence
partakes also of a very distinct political character. In
fact, the Christians of the whole of this district enjoy a far
more efficient protection against the oppression of the Turkish
government than do the Moslems themselves.
</p>

<p>
The monastery is a modern building, and if it only had
a tall chimney instead of a cupola it would look more like a
manufactory than a religious edifice. The top of the cupola
is five hundred and fifty feet above the level of the sea, which
is immediately beneath, and commands a magnificent view.
When Napoleon besieged Acre in 1799, and was compelled
to raise the siege and retreat, the Turks fell upon the wounded
French soldiers who were left in hospital here and massacred
them to a man. The convent was, of course, deserted,
and soon after fell into ruin. For twenty-seven years this
<span class="pageno target" title="81" id="page-81"></span>
much venerated spot was abandoned, but the order to which
it had given its name never ceased to agitate for the restoration
of its sanctuary, and the work of reconstruction was
finally undertaken in 1826, by Jean Baptiste, and completed
in 1853. So the present building is only thirty years old.
In front of the main terrace is a flower-garden and some
trellised vines, in the centre of which is a pyramid surmounted
by a cross, with an inscription to the effect that it
commemorates the resting-place of the bones of the French
soldiers. It was not till five years after their massacre that
Father Jules du St. Sauveur ventured back to the mountain,
where he found these melancholy traces of the tragedy
scattered among the ruins, and, collecting them, hid them
in a cave until, under more auspicious circumstances, they
could receive a Christian burial. There can be no doubt
that the order is now increasing in wealth and influence, and
expectation runs high that the day is not far distant when
northern Palestine will become a French province, and when
its prosperity will be still further secured.

<a href="#toc-17">A SUMMER CAMP ON CARMEL.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Esfia</span>, Aug. 20.—The fact that the cholera was raging in
Egypt, that in the ordinary course of events it was certain
to visit Syria, that even if it did not, the months of July,
August, and September are disagreeably hot at Haifa, determined
me to make the experiment of camping out on the
highest point of Carmel, and I am at this moment sitting
under a Bedouin tent, arranged after a fashion of my own,
at an altitude of eighteen hundred feet above the level of
the sea, upon which I look down in two opposite directions.
</p>

<p>
On the northwest, distant six miles, curves the Bay of
Acre, with the town itself glistening white in the distance;
and on the southwest, distant seven miles, the Mediterranean
breaks upon the beach that bounds the plain of Sharon, and
with a good glass I can make out the outlines of the ruins
of the old port of Cæsarea. Southward are the confused
hills known as the mountains of Samaria; beyond them, in
the blue haze, I can indistinctly see the highlands of Gilead;
while nearer still, Mount Gilboa, Mount Tabor, the Nazareth
range, with a house or two of that town visible, and
Mount Hermon, rising behind the high ranges of northern
Galilee, are all comprised in a prospect unrivalled in its panoramic
extent and in the interest attached to the localities
upon which the eye rests in every direction. I was some
time picking out just the spot on which to camp, so many
advantageous sites suggested themselves, but the paramount
necessity of being near a village for security and supplies,
and, above all, near a good spring, decided me in favour of
my present location; and as the conditions under which I
have brought a large party up to the top of this somewhat
inaccessible mountain and planted them upon it are novel,
I venture to think that an account of our experience may
prove interesting.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="83" id="page-83"></span>
</div>

<p>
In the first place, the village itself was out of the question,
partly because Arab houses, as a rule, do not consist of
more than one room, and even when one has turned out their
human inhabitants, it still remains tenanted by so many
others of a carnivorous character, though minute in size,
that existence becomes a burden; and partly because they
are pervaded with a singular odour of burnt manure, which
the natives use as fuel for the ovens in which they bake
their bread, and which is too pungent to be agreeable to
unsophisticated nostrils. After inhaling it for a month I
have got rather to like it than otherwise. As I suspected
that such might be the case, and believed that a successful
was might be waged against the insects, I decided on hiring
one of these rooms as a guest-chamber and a place of resort
from the midday sun, in case the camp did not prove a sufficient
protection. This room was nothing more nor less
than a vault like a cellar, with stone walls and a stone roof,
supported by cross arches, about twenty feet by thirty; and
I may here mention that the precaution turned out wise, for
we got fairly rid of the fleas, and the temperature in the
middle of the day, when we usually repair to it for our siesta,
has never been over 80°. But how to make a camp which
should accommodate three ladies and four gentlemen was a
serious question. We had one European tent capable of
holding two people, and a smaller one for a bachelor of
modest requirements in the way of standing-room, and these
we supplemented with a tent which we hired of some neighbouring
Bedouins, which was thirty feet long, but which,
when pitched according to their fashion, was an impossible
habitation for civilized beings, as it had no walls. Indeed,
the whole breadth of the black camel's-hair cloth of which
it was composed was only ten feet. We therefore decided
on using it merely as a roof, and sent down to Haifa for
a camel load of light lumber in order to make a frame on
which to stretch it. We also got up two dozen cheap mats,
six feet square, at twenty-five cents apiece. With these we
made front and back walls and partitions for sleeping cribs.
Finally our erection, on which we proudly hoisted the national
flag, was thirty-four feet long, ten feet wide, seven
feet high in front and five feet in rear. These mats can be
<span class="pageno target" title="84" id="page-84"></span>
triced up in front and rear in the daytime so as to allow a
free circulation of air. On the roof, in order to keep the
sun from heating too fiercely upon us, we spread branches
of the odorous bay-tree, with which the scrubby woods of
the mountain abound, and of these same branches we erected
a kitchen, and stable for the horse and three donkeys which
composed our establishment. The thermometer usually fell
to 70° at night, and there were heavy morning dews and
fogs.
</p>

<p>
It was no slight task selecting the furniture, bedding,
cooking-utensils, and comestibles for a party of seven, and
it took eight camels, besides sundry donkeys, to carry all our
necessaries. In order to understand the nature of the path
over which we had to travel, the reader must get rid of the
popular notion conveyed by the word “Mount,” which is
usually applied to Carmel, that it is a solitary hill. So far
from such being the case, it is a mountainous district about
fourteen miles long and twelve wide at its base. It culminates
in a promontory, which projects into the sea at its
apex, but we are established ten miles from Haifa, the path
ascending abruptly from that town, and following for nearly
three hours' travel the backbone of the ridge, disclosing
views of wondrous beauty down gorges on the right and
left. It is “a rocky road to travel” for a delicate lady,
involving steep, precipitous ascents, for which sure-footed
donkeys are best; but we were obliged to resort to a chair
and a litter, each carried by four bearers, who, as they stumbled
and clambered up the narrow path, seemed bent upon
capsizing their human burdens. Now, however, that we
have safely endured the perils of the way, we are amply repaid
for them.
</p>

<p>
The nights and mornings are of ideal beauty. The effects
of sunrise and sunset, ever varying, over the vast landscape
that stretches around and beneath us, are a constant
source of wonder and delight. From the vine-covered terrace
on which our camp is situated we look down a wild,
rocky, precipitous gorge eighteen hundred feet upon the
plain of the Kishon, scarce a mile distant, so steep is it. To
the right this gorge widens into an amphitheatre, and the
hillsides, sloping more gently, are terraced with vines, figs,
<span class="pageno target" title="85" id="page-85"></span>
and pomegranates, and at its head is the copious spring
which supplies us with water, to which one of our donkeys
makes several pilgrimages a day with a large earthen jar
slung in a straw cradle on each side. Here, morning and
evening, files of Druse women resort, and stand and gossip
round the cistern into which the water gushes from the
rock, their bright-coloured dresses forming a charming contrast
with the dark-green foliage of the gardens and orchards
that are irrigated in the immediate vicinity. Besides
about five hundred Druses there are fifty Christians
in the village, who do not harmonize with the Druses very
well, and there is a hot rivalry for our favour, so that we
have to exercise a considerable amount of diplomacy to
keep on good terms with all.
</p>

<p>
We have hired the vault from a Christian, and his family
next door consists of his stepmother and four half-sisters,
strapping, good-looking wenches, who are not yet married,
for lack of the necessary dowers. With them is staying a
cousin from Acre, one of the most beautiful women I have
ever seen, quite Caucasian in type and complexion, which is
white and transparent as that of any Western beauty. We
have great difficulty in keeping this bevy of damsels out of
our room, as Arabs have no idea of privacy, and they imagine
that politeness consists in squatting round in a circle
and asking silly questions. Excepting for the practice it
gives one in Arabic, and for a certain insight which one thus
gains into the manners and customs of the natives, these
visits would be intolerable, and, indeed, we have found it
necessary to take stringent measures to limit them. It is
more interesting to go and sit in the cool veranda outside
of the little Druse place of worship, and talk to the bright
young man who is passing most of his time in studying the
abstruse metaphysical system of his religion, and who is far
more intelligent than the Syrian Catholic priest, who also
comes and sits and smokes with us with the view of obtaining,
which he has not yet succeeded in doing, some knowledge
of our own religious belief. Now and then an episode
occurs illustrating the conditions of native existence in these
parts. One day I found the village excited at an outrage
which a native mounted policeman had perpetrated. On
<span class="pageno target" title="86" id="page-86"></span>
learning that he had assaulted not merely one of the villagers,
but my own servant, who had refused him access to
our vault, I inflicted a little corporal punishment upon him,
when his officer and the village notables interfered, and interceded
in his behalf. I asked the latter why they were
not glad to see a man punished who, like the rest of his
class, was forever persecuting them; they said that when I
was gone he would come back and take his revenge upon
them. I finally made the man apologize to the Druse he
had assaulted, and to my servant, all which he did very
humbly, fearing that unless he did so I should insist upon
his receiving a still severer punishment from the Caimacan,
or local governor, at Haifa. The villagers were very grateful
to see one of this arrogant and overbearing class humbled,
but they say that unless one can stay and protect them
their last state will be worse than their first.

<a href="#toc-18">THE DRUSES OF MOUNT CARMEL.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">In Camp, Mount Carmel</span>, Sept. 10.—It is not generally
known that the Druse nation extends as far south as Carmel.
The most southern village occupied by them in Syria is
at Dalieh, about two miles from my present camp; their most
northern home is at Aleppo. When, nine hundred years ago,
Duruzi, the teacher from whom they take their name, came
from Egypt to spread his new teaching, it was accepted by
a tribe of people who lived in the neighbourhood of Aleppo,
whither they had originally migrated from the province of
Yemen, in Arabia. Adopting the new and mysterious faith,
which, while it is a most interesting metaphysical and theological
study, is too recondite to enter upon here, the body
of the tribe migrated south, took possession of the valleys
of the southern Lebanon, and made their headquarters
at the foot of Mount Hermon. Spreading east from
there, they crossed the tract known in ancient times as
Iturea, and found a natural fortress in the volcanic region
anciently called Trachonitis, the Biblical Argob, and
in the mountains now called the Jebel Druse. Here they
increased and multiplied, and in the early part of the seventeenth
century produced that most remarkable warrior
Fakr-Eddin, the only man of note of whom the Druses can
boast. He conquered Beyrout and the southern coast
towns, extending his sway as far south as Carmel, and as
far east as Tiberias; and under his auspices the mountains
of Galilee and Carmel became settled by Druses.
</p>

<p>
It is, therefore, not much more than two hundred and
fifty years since the Druses first came to Carmel, and it is
probable that when they did so they found the mountain
wholly unoccupied, excepting by a few Christian hermits
and devotees who lived in its caves—for the Carmelite
monks had been driven away and their monastery destroyed
<span class="pageno target" title="88" id="page-88"></span>
three hundred years before; and, indeed, it was only at the
time of the Druse occupation that the first attempt was
made to restore it. For the two centuries during which
the crusaders held the Holy Land prior to the end of the
thirteenth century, Carmel was occupied by them, and the
remains of their military posts are still to be found on
many of the summits of the mountain; indeed, many of
the old stones of which the village of Esfia is built, near
which my camp is situated, bear their devices carved on
them. Before the time of the crusaders there may have
been Moslem villages on Carmel, but its glory departed
when Palestine was conquered by the Saracens in the
seventh century, and the last remains of Roman civilization,
the traces of which still cover the mountain, were destroyed.
</p>

<p>
About the time of Christ, and for four or five centuries
afterwards, it must have been in its full loveliness, its hillsides
terraced with vineyards or clothed with magnificent
forests, and its summits crowned with towns adorned with
the grace and beauty of the architecture of the period.
The discoveries I have made in proof of this I will postpone
to another letter, as my intention now is to describe
the present population by which the mountain is inhabited.
</p>

<p>
It is a curious fact that to this day there are no Moslems
on Carmel proper. There are five or six Moslem villages
at its base, on the various sides of the triangle which comprises
the district, and they have lands running up into the
mountain; but the actual population consists of two Druse
villages, numbering together about eight hundred souls, and
about fifty Christians, besides the twenty-five monks who
inhabit the monastery. The mountain is nevertheless capable
of containing a population of many thousands, as it evidently
did in old times, and is a much larger district than is
popularly supposed.
</p>

<p>
The eastern side, from the apex of the triangle, is thirteen
miles in length, the western twelve, and the base nine, giving
a total circumference to this highland region of thirty—four
miles. The tract comprised in this area is beautifully
diversified by wild gorges, grassy valleys, level or undulating
plateaus covered with underwood, and rocky summits;
<span class="pageno target" title="89" id="page-89"></span>
and the scenery in places is as romantic as can well be
imagined. The two Druse villages of Esfia and Dalieh are
situated two miles apart, about three quarters of the way
down the triangle from its apex (the projecting promontory
on which the monastery is built), and occupy the most fertile
part of the mountain.
</p>

<p>
When the Druses first settled here they founded no
fewer than eight villages, but when, forty years ago, this
country was conquered by Egypt and governed by Ibrahim
Pacha, his rule was distasteful to the majority of Druses,
and the inhabitants of six villages abandoned them, and
migrated to the Jebel Druse. All these villages occupied
the sites of ancient Roman towns, and were constructed of
the ancient stones. In the course of my rambles I have
visited them all. Of the two villages which remained, one,
Dalieh, was occupied by some families which had migrated
direct from Aleppo; the other, Esfia, is peopled by Druses
from the Lebanon. There is a marked difference between
the two, and the people of Dalieh are far superior to those
of Esfia.
</p>

<p>
I went over there the other day, and spent the day and
night as the guest of the sheik—or, I should rather say, of
the sheiks, for there are two—one is the temporal and the
other the spiritual head of the village—and I divided my
attentions and my meals equally between them. They are
very reluctant to talk about their religion, always turning
the subject when any attempt is made to induce them to
converse about it; but there is one question which they always
ask, and that is whether there are any Druses in England.
As it is an accepted fact among them that there are,
any denial of it is considered a discreet reticence, and rather
a proof than otherwise that one is somewhat of a Druse
one's self. They also believe that the majority of Chinamen
are, unconsciously to themselves, Druses; and they are
firmly convinced that the world is drawing to a close, and
that the appearance of Hakim, a divine incarnation, which
was prophesied to take place nine hundred years after his
last manifestation and translation, is now imminent, as the
time is just about expiring.
</p>

<p>
The Druses are a sober, fairly honest, and industrious people,
<span class="pageno target" title="90" id="page-90"></span>
and have their own notions of morality, to which they
rigidly adhere. They have only one wife, but they have
great facilities of divorce. An amusing illustration of this
came under my immediate notice while I was the sheik's
guest. His son, a fine young man, had been my guide
among some neighbouring ruins the day before. I had also
made the acquaintance of the wife of the latter, a remarkably
pretty woman, with a baby. Indeed, I was much
struck with the beauty of the type of all the Dalieh women.
Suddenly a tremendous uproar took place in the village.
My host rushed out to restore order. While I looked
down on the scene from an upper window, I saw his son,
bareheaded, brandishing a huge stone in the air, and vehemently
gesticulating, apparently in reply to a bevy of women
who were screaming at him at the top of their voices.
Indeed, all the women in the place seemed to have conspired
to drive him to frenzy by their abuse. When the
sheik appeared in the midst of them order was somewhat
restored, for, to my surprise, he seemed to take part with
the women, and dealt his son one or two sound blows.
Then there was some palavering, and during the whole time
I saw the wife of the enraged young man looking calmly on
as a spectator. She had put her child in its cradle and was
rocking it. Two or three old women were crying and still
vociferating. Presently I saw a man come and lift the
cradle with the baby, and the mother rose and followed him.
They went into a neighbouring house, and were followed by
the sheik and as many as could crowd in. Then ensued a
long pause, until the sheik reappeared, with a document
which he had been writing, in his hand, and the village population
gathered around. At this time I could not see his son
anywhere, but the wife was among the audience. When he
had finished reading, the audience broke up and the sheik
returned to me. When I asked what had been the matter,
he replied, “Oh, foolish people quarrelling.” So I applied
elsewhere for information, and was told that for some time
past the sheik's son had been tired of his wife and in love
with another woman, and had been seeking a cause of quarrel.
He had apparently found it in some dispute he had just
been having with his wife, and had uttered in his rage the
<span class="pageno target" title="91" id="page-91"></span>
formula of divorce, by which he dismissed her and sent her
back to her family. Hence the feminine outbreak against
him. The sheik had disapproved his son's conduct, as the
wife was his own niece, and, therefore, her husband's first
cousin, and he considered it a family disgrace; but, after
what had happened, patching up the matter had become impossible,
and he had nothing for it but, according to Druse
law, to pronounce the divorce. I must say that the entire indifference
manifested by the wife, when she followed her
baby's cradle away from her husband's house, deprived her
of the sympathy I should otherwise have felt.
</p>

<p>
From what I have been able to gather, the Druse women,
if they are pretty, are a heartless lot. Another characteristic
incident was a procession of Esfia Druses to the cave of
Elijah, below the monastery, in fulfilment of a vow, when a
child was dedicated to a religious life, and a goat was sacrificed
to God, as in the times of old. After being sacrificed,
it was nevertheless eaten, which seems somewhat to deprive
the performance of its merit, as the share of the Deity was
the bones. There was a great clanging of discordant instruments
and loud singing as they came back, some of the
men caracoling around on horseback, and others, with arms
clasped, dancing in a measured step, followed by a group
of dancing women, in dark-blue garments, with gaudy borders
and fringes and sashes, and flowing white head-dresses
bound with bright-coloured scarfs. They formed a most
picturesque tableau, chanting their way to their home on
this wild mountain hill-top.
</p>

<p>
One day a magnificent figure of a man, armed with sword
and pistol, suddenly entered my tent. I asked him where
he had come from. He said from the Jebel Druse, and,
seeing a foreign tent, he had turned in to see who I was. So
we exchanged confidences. He was, in fact, an outlaw. He
had been fighting against the government, and was wandering
from one Druse village to another, not daring to go back
to his own, which was in the Lebanon. He said that at this
moment the Druses of the Jebel Druse were in full revolt
against the Turkish government; that no Druse dare show
himself in Damascus, and no Turk dare show himself in the
Jebel Druse. They had defied the Governor-General, who
<span class="pageno target" title="92" id="page-92"></span>
knew that it would be useless in their wild mountains to attempt
to conquer them. He offered to take me to the Jebel
Druse, if I would avoid all places where there were any
Turks. He had a profound contempt for his coreligionists
of Dalieh and Esfia. “I am ashamed of such Druses,” he
said. “Why, I saw a Moslem insult one, the other day, and,
instead of killing him, he walked away. Why don't they
leave a place where they dare not punish insult, and come
to the mountain?” I have rarely seen a finer specimen of
humanity than this man was, and, with all the defiant recklessness
and daring of his expression, there was the charm of
entire frankness and good-nature combined with it.
</p>

<p>
Besides the two villages on Carmel, there are fourteen
Druse villages, nearly all within sight of it, on the southern
slopes of the mountains of Galilee. It is not improbable
that, unable to support the military conscription and taxation
which presses upon them, the inhabitants may, before
long, abandon their present homes, and go to swell the numbers
of their brethren in the Jebel Druse. The whole population
of the Druse nation is about 120,000; they can put
into the field 25,000 men of the best fighting material in
Turkey; they are slowly migrating to the Jebel Druse,
where about two thirds of the nation have already asserted
their semi-independence.

<a href="#toc-19">EXPLORATION ON CARMEL.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, Sept. 24.—During the two months that I have been
camped on the highest summit of Mount Carmel, I have
visited no fewer than twenty ruins of ancient towns and
villages. Of these I have discovered six which were heretofore
unknown, the others having been found ten years ago
by the officers of the Royal Engineers sent out to survey
Palestine by the Society for Palestine Exploration.
</p>

<p>
Prior to that time, this historic locality was a <i>terra incognita</i>.
The tourists who visited the mountain, like the pilgrims
who journeyed thither for devotional reasons, satisfied
themselves with a short stay at the convent, and even then
did not understand that they were only on one mountain
spur of a highland region thirty-five miles in circumference,
where almost every hilltop was crowned with a ruin, and
every gorge might open up new and unexpected beauties of
scenery.
</p>

<p>
It is only after so exhaustive an examination as I have just
accomplished that any idea can be formed of the extent of
the population by which Carmel was once inhabited, of the
high state of civilization which must have prevailed here,
and of the extent to which its lovely hills and valleys were
cultivated. These ruins bear a great resemblance to each
other; and although <span id="theynone">none</span> of them covers a very great
extent of ground, they were built of most solid materials,
and, to judge by some of the architectural remains, and the
elaborate carvings and devices, they must have contained
some handsome buildings.
</p>

<p>
The houses were built of blocks of drafted stone, usually
four feet long by two and a half high, and two thick. The
door-jambs and lintels, which in some instances are still in
situ, were often seven or eight feet long by two feet six
by two feet. In these were holes or sockets, in which the
<span class="pageno target" title="94" id="page-94"></span>
pivots worked. Some of the lintels over the doors were ornamented
with devices; these were usually hexagons and
circles, in the centre of which were ovals or other ornamental
scrolls. Sometimes there was a bird or an animal,
such as an eagle or a leopard, or seven-branched candlesticks,
or raised bosses or crosses; here and there was a cornice with
a florid carving, evidently of the Roman period, with fragments
of columns or capitals. But some of these ruins have
been inhabited by later inhabitants, who used the old stones
for their modern constructions, and too often chipped off the
carving. Indeed, they are the ready-made quarries of the
country people of the present day, who come and carry off
the stones to build their houses.
</p>

<p>
A notable and melancholy instance of this has occurred in
the case of a place called Khurbet Semmaka. This was the
most interesting ruin in Carmel, and was discovered ten
years ago by the officers of the Palestine Exploration Survey.
Here they found the portal of what once had been an
ancient Jewish synagogue still standing, its door-jambs and
lintels elaborately <span id="carved">carved;</span> part of the walls and fragments of
the columns which formed an enclosing colonnade were in
position, and formed the subject of much speculation, as it
was the only specimen of Jewish architecture in this part of
the country, and presented some features which were different
from anything hitherto discovered; and it was therefore
suggested that the building must have been built at a
different period from any of those the remains of which still
exist. Judge of my disappointment on visiting this spot to
find that, with the exception of three feet of one door-jamb,
all had disappeared; there was scarcely a stone left. The
inhabitants of a Moslem village about two miles distant had
within the last decade made a clean sweep of all these most
interesting remains. Fortunately they still exist in the
Palestine Society's Memoirs in the shape of most elaborate
drawings and measurements, which were made by the Survey
and have since been published.
</p>

<p>
Apart from the actual stones themselves and the carvings
which are to be found upon them, the objects of interest
which mainly characterize all these Carmel ruins are ancient
olive-mills and wine-presses, often in a very perfect state of
<span class="pageno target" title="95" id="page-95"></span>
preservation, tombs and cisterns. First, in regard to the
olive-mills. I found more than a dozen of these. On two
occasions they were hewn out of the living rock. The lower
stone, which was circular, had usually a diameter of eight
feet, with a raised rim outside nine or ten inches high,
and a raised socket in the centre, in which was a hole a foot
square, where the upright was fitted to hold the lateral beam
which worked the upper stone. This was usually five feet
in diameter and eighteen inches thick, and had a hole pierced
through the centre. Through this the long beam was passed,
to which, as it extended far beyond the circumference of the
lower stone, the horse was attached which worked the mill,
the upper stone travelling on its broad edge around the lower
stone, over the olives. From the lower stone a gutter was
carved into the vat, also hewn out of the living rock, into
which trickled the oil. I often found near these mills huge
limestone rollers about three feet in diameter and seven feet
long. On the sides of these were four vertical lines of sunk
grooves, four or five grooves in each line. Taking 2.7 as
the specific gravity of the stone, they must have weighed
about two tons each. What their functions were, or whether
they had anything to do with the olive-crushing process, I am
at a loss to conjecture. The wine-presses were nothing more
than huge vats, also hewn out of the living rock, sometimes
above ground, in the shape of sarcophagi, sometimes pits
eight or nine feet square and the same in depth.
</p>

<p>
The limestone hillsides in the neighbourhood of these ruins
were almost invariably honeycombed with cave tombs, whose
doorways were often rudely ornamented with devices, and
in one instance I found an inscription in Greek characters so
much defaced that I could not decipher it. They usually
consisted of only one chamber, eight or ten feet square, but
were sometimes larger, and contained either kokim or loculi
under arcosolia, sometimes both. The kokim are tunnel-shaped
excavations, usually seven feet long, two feet six
wide, and the same in height—in other words, just large
enough to contain a corpse. The loculus is an oblong tomb,
with sides about two feet high, also large enough conveniently
to contain a body. It is cut out of the living rock, as well
as the arch which overspans it. Sometimes there is a large,
<span class="pageno target" title="96" id="page-96"></span>
arched recess opening out of the central chamber, containing
several loculi. On more than one occasion I found a circular
stone like a millstone in a groove in the doorway, which
only required to be rolled a couple of feet to close the tomb
completely, but the tombs are generally closed by an oblong
stone slab, not unfrequently ornamented with devices. I
also found several sarcophagi.
</p>

<p>
The cisterns are of two kinds, bell-mouthed and of demijohn
shape, or open rock-hewn reservoirs or tanks. At one
ruin I found an extensive system of these latter. There were
no fewer than six, of which the largest was forty feet square,
all close together, divided only by narrow ledges of the solid
rock out of which they had been hewn. They were from
fifteen to twenty feet to the soil at the bottom, now overgrown
with shrubs, so that in reality they are probably much
deeper. In some cases stone steps lead to the bottom, and
on the sides were deep niches from which evidently sprang
arches to form the roof, for there can be little doubt that the
most of them were originally covered. From the great number
and extent of these cisterns it is manifest that the inhabitants
were, in some instances, entirely dependent upon
them for their water supply.
</p>

<p>
At the southeastern extremity of the mountain is the spot
known as “the place of burning,” or sacrifice, because tradition
assigns it as the locality where Elijah had his controversy
with the prophets of Baal, and in commemoration
thereof the Carmelite monks are at this moment building a
church there, and using, by the way, some of the carved
stones of a neighbouring ruin, regardless of all antiquarian
considerations. I feel, therefore, a malignant satisfaction in
the conviction at which I have arrived that they are building
their church on a spot which is indisputably not the
place on which the altar of Elijah was erected, if we are to
believe the Biblical record, for it is in full view of the Mediterranean,
and it would have been quite unnecessary for
Elijah to tell his servant to “go up and look toward the
sea,” for there is no higher point to go up to, and he could
see the sea himself. But about a mile from this spot there
stands, curiously enough, a pile of stones in a locality which
would exactly fulfil the required conditions. I came upon
<span class="pageno target" title="97" id="page-97"></span>
it unexpectedly, almost concealed in a thicket of underwood.
The stones are placed one upon the other without cement,
and average eighteen inches square and eight or nine thick,
forming a rude altar about twelve feet long and four high.
The breadth varies, as they have been broken away, but
there is a large artificial slab, six feet square, lying at the
base. Though I do not for a moment mean to imply that
this was the original altar, the unusual shape and position of
this pile suggests that it may have been the result of some
sacred tradition connected with the Biblical event, or it may
be the remains of an ancient vineyard watch-tower. From
it the ground swells back and upward in every direction, so
that a vast host might have been assembled around and
witnessed whatever was going forward, which would
have been impossible at the traditional locality. A ten
minutes' walk would have taken Elijah's servant to a neighbouring
summit which commanded a full view of the sea,
and the twelve barrels of water required to drench the altar
could have been obtained from some rock-hewn tanks in the
immediate vicinity, while the path that passes the pile leads
straight down to the hill on the bank of the Kishon, where
tradition has it that the priests were massacred. Moreover,
it was in the centre of the most populous part of the mountain.
Within a radius of two miles and a half from this pile of
stones there are no fewer than twelve ruins of ancient towns
and villages on the various hill-tops and mountain-spurs
which surround it.
</p>

<p>
No fact could give a better idea than this of the populous
character of Carmel in the days of the prophet. Not very
far from this I discovered, half-way down the steep flank of
the mountain, a fortress of a most ancient race, the stones
which were piled one above another three high to form the
rampart being immense natural unhewn boulders weighing
from two to three tons each. I am not aware of anything
of the kind having yet been found in Palestine, and as carrying
one back to a period probably anterior to Jewish occupation,
I regard it as the most interesting discovery I have
made on Carmel.

coast, from Antioch to Gaza, none has had a more eventful
history than Acre, or one which more directly affected the
fortunes of the rest of the country at large. Napoleon I.
called it the key of Palestine, and it is doubtless owing to
its important strategical position that it has undergone so
many vicissitudes, and been the scene of so many sanguinary
battles. There is, indeed, probably no similar area on the
face of the globe on which so much blood has been shed.
</p>

<p>
I was at some trouble the other day to add up the list of
sieges it has undergone, and the total was fifteen, not counting
doubtful ones in the earliest history of the country,
when it was invaded and conquered by the ancient Egyptians;
but beginning with the siege of Acre by Shalmaneser,
721 <span class="sc small">B.C.</span>, when the fortress belonged to the Tyrians, and
ending with its bombardment, in <span class="sc small">A.D.</span> 1840, by the English
Admiral Sir Charles Napier, the list is one which suggests
a record of blood unparalleled in history. Its worst time
was undoubtedly during the two hundred years when it was
taken and retaken several times by Crusaders and Saracens
successively. On one of these occasions when, after a two
years' siege, the town fell into the hands of the Saracens,
sixty thousand Christians are said to have fallen by the
sword. The place is still shown, at the northeast salient of
the outer wall, where stood the English tower, which was
guarded by the troops of Richard Cœur de Lion.
</p>

<p>
The town now contains only about nine thousand inhabitants,
cooped up by the fortifications in the very limited
area of about fifty acres; and it is more picturesque than
agreeable to live in. There is no more characteristic bazaar
in the East than that of Acre, with its motley crowd of
wild Bedouins from the desert, Persian devotees gathering
<span class="pageno target" title="99" id="page-99"></span>
around a Persian holy man who has taken up his residence
here, Turkish soldiers who form its garrison, Druses, with
their white turbans and striped abeihs, or overcoats, Metawalis,
who are wild and gipsy-looking Moslem schismatics,
Syrian Christians, and Moslem peasantry; add to these veiled
women, long strings of camels, with an occasional foreigner,
or sailor from a merchant-ship in the harbour, and you get
a population as varied as any town in the country can show.
Acre, therefore, is a most interesting place to spend a day
in, apart from any antiquarian attraction it may possess, or
monuments of more modern architecture which are worthy
of attention.
</p>

<p>
There are few finer mosques in Syria than that of Jezzar
Pacha, which stands within a large rectangular area, where
there are vaulted galleries, supported by ancient columns
ornamented by capitals brought from the ruins of Tyre and
Cæsarea. Along these galleries have been built cells, destined
for the people employed at the mosque, or the pilgrims
who came to visit it. They surround a magnificent
court, under which are cisterns, and upon which are palms,
cypress, and other trees. Among them are white marble
tombs, notably those of Jezzar and Suleiman Pacha. The
town contains three other mosques, the columns in which
and the pavement have certainly belonged to more ancient
buildings. There are four Christian churches in the city,
which belong to the Roman Catholics, the Schismatic Greeks,
the Maronites, and the United Greeks respectively. Under
the house of the Sisters of Nazareth and the neighbouring
houses extend vast vaulted cellars which are now divided
by walls of separation, and belong to different proprietors;
they are doubtless of crusading origin. Deep cisterns also
date from that period. Of the same date also are certain
remains of walls and vaults near the convent, which are the
ruins of a church almost completely destroyed. The most
remarkable khan is near the port, called the Khan el Aurid
on account of its columns, the galleries surrounding it being
built on pillars of gray or red granite, covered by capitals
of different orders, brought from more ancient monuments.
</p>

<p>
The citadel, as may be imagined, has often been destroyed
and rebuilt. On one side is the military hospital, the lower
<span class="pageno target" title="100" id="page-100"></span>
part of which belongs entirely to crusaders' work, and consists
of large subterranean magazines. In the middle is a
great court, shaded by fig, palm, and other trees, under
which are vaulted galleries and cisterns. Under the ramparts
also extend immense ogival vaults, many of which belong
to the time of the crusades. These have furnished
magazines for later defenders of the fortress, and, during the
bombardment by the English in 1840, the principal one exploded,
with a loss to the defenders of 1600 men, 30 camels,
50 asses, besides horses, cows, and a great store of arms.
Some of the guns lying about the ramparts are of old French
manufacture, with the dates 1785, '86, '87. They are those
which were sent by sea, for the use of Napoleon, but were
captured by Sir Sydney Smith, and brought here to serve
for the defence of the city. About half a mile from the
city walls is an artificial hill or tumulus, called Napoleon's
Hill, from the fact that he used it as his headquarters during
one of the sieges of Acre. It was occupied for the same purpose
six hundred years before by Richard Cœur de Lion.
</p>

<p>
In ancient times Acre was the most populous and flourishing
port on the sea-coast after the decline of Tyre and Sidon,
and contained an immense population; the town must have
extended over the plain to the east of the city, which is still
rich in ancient débris, fragments of pottery, and marble
carvings. A great part of the modern fortification has been
built from the ruins of Athlit, which I have described in a
former letter, and which, before it was thus despoiled at the
beginning of this century, must have been an ancient crusading
fortress in almost perfect condition. When one
thinks how lately it has been destroyed, one is all the more
inclined to regret the disappearance of a monument which
would have been the most interesting relic of its kind in existence.
Acre possesses little Biblical interest. It is only
mentioned once in the Old Testament, where it is alluded to
as being a town from which the tribe of Asher, in whose
territory it was situated, did not succeed in driving the Canaanites,
but seemed to have lived with them in it upon
friendly terms; and once in the New Testament, where, under
the name of Ptolemais, it was visited by Paul on his
way from Greece to Jerusalem.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="101" id="page-101"></span>
</div>

<p>
There are many old people now in Acre who tell thrilling
stories of the episodes which occurred here during the years
when it was occupied by the Egyptians, between 1830 and
1840, and when it became necessary not merely to conciliate
the conquerors, but to play a double game of keeping
on good terms with the Turks, to whom it was ultimately,
and, as it now turns out, foolishly, restored by the British;
but none so thrilling as those which they have heard from
their fathers, of the incidents which marked the reigns of
Jezzar and Abdullah Pacha, especially the former. The following
story was told me by the son of the man who was
the confidential secretary of this fiend in human shape, who
gloried in the name of “The Butcher.” In youth he sold
himself to a slave-merchant in Constantinople, and, being
purchased by Ali Bey of Egypt, he rose from the humble
station of a mameluke to be Governor of Cairo. In 1773
he was placed by the Emir of the Druses in command at
Beyrout. There his first act was to seize 50,000 piastres,
the property of the emir, and the second to declare that he
acknowledged no superior but the sultan. The emir, by the
aid of a Russian fleet, drove Jezzar from Beyrout, but he was
soon after made Pacha of Acre and Sidon. Under his vigorous
rule the pachalik extended from Baalbec on the north
to Jerusalem on the south. My informant told me that he
was not originally a cruel man, but that one day he was
playing with a little daughter who pulled his beard. “This
is very wrong,” he said; “how did you learn to play with
men's beards?” “Oh,” she replied, “I always play with the
beards of the mamelukes when they visit the ladies of the
harem in your absence.” This excited a fit of frenzied jealousy.
Taking an escort, he announced that he was going
on an official visit to a distant part of his pachalik. When
he was a stage out of Acre, he told his escort to remain
where they were, disguised himself, and returned rapidly
and secretly to his harem. Here he found all his favourite
wives disporting themselves with his mamelukes or military
body-guard. Instantly he drew his cimeter and fell, not
upon the men, but upon the women. Fifteen of these he is
said to have killed with his own hand, and then, growing
tired of the effort, he called in some soldiers to complete the
<span class="pageno target" title="102" id="page-102"></span>
massacre, not leaving one alive. My informant did not remember
the total number slain. The mamelukes rushed to
the great magazines, and swore they would blow themselves
up and the whole town if a hair of their heads was touched.
They were allowed, therefore, to saddle their horses and
ride of in peace; but from that day the whole character of
Jezzar Pacha was changed, and he made it a rule never to
allow a week to pass without executions. His Jew banker
was a handsome man. One day Jezzar complimented him
on his looks, and then, calling a servant, ordered him to put
out one of the Jew's eyes. Some time after Jezzar observed
that the banker had arranged his turban so as almost
to hide the lost eye, and he then, without a moment's hesitation,
had his nose cut off. The poor Jew finally lost his
head. The family of this man are still among the chief
bankers of Damascus.
</p>

<p>
This butcher also employed his own leisure moments in
unexpectedly drawing his sword and cutting off the ears
and noses of his favourites and the people about him, and
sometimes their heads, with his own hand. This was the
man whom Napoleon besieged in Acre, and with whom
British troops were unfortunately compelled to ally themselves
to prevent the fortress from falling into French hands.
My informant told me that during the latter years of Jezzar
Pacha's life his character again changed for the better, and
he gradually gave up his cruel practices. In fact, he described
his cruelty as a monomania produced by a fit of
jealousy, which it took him some years to get over.

<a href="#toc-21">THE BABS AND THEIR PROPHET.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, Nov. 7.—The Nahr N'aman, called by the ancients
the river Belus, rises in a large marsh at the base of a
mound in the plain of Acre called the Tell Kurdany, and,
after a short course of four miles, fed by the swampy ground
through which it passes, it attains considerable dimensions.
Before falling into the sea it winds through an extensive
date-grove, and then, twisting its way between banks of
fine sand, falls into the ocean scarcely two miles from the
walls of Acre. Pliny tells us that glass was first made by
the ancients from the sands of this river, and the numerous
specimens of old glass which I found in grubbing bear testimony
to the extensive usage of this material in the neighbourhood.
The beach at its mouth was also celebrated as
a locality where the shells which yielded the Tyrian purple
were to be found in great abundance, and I have succeeded
in extracting the dye from some of those I have collected
here. It was also renowned for a colossal statue of Memnon,
which, according to Pliny, was upon its banks, but the
site of this has not been accurately identified. The only
point of attraction now upon its waters is a garden belonging
to an eminent Persian, whose residence at Acre is invested
with such peculiar interest that I made an expedition
to his pleasure-ground on the chance of discovering something
more in regard to him than it was possible to do at
Haifa.
</p>

<p>
Turning sharply to the right before reaching Acre, and
passing beneath the mound upon which Napoleon planted
his batteries in 1799, we enter a grove of date-trees by a
road bordered with high cactus hedges, and finally reach a
causeway which traverses a small lake formed by the waters
of the Belus, and which, crossing one arm of the river, lands
us upon an island which it encircles. This island, which is
<span class="pageno target" title="104" id="page-104"></span>
about two hundred yards long by scarcely a hundred wide,
is all laid out in flower-beds and planted with ornamental
shrubs and with fruit-trees. Coming upon it suddenly it is
like a scene in fairy land. In the centre is a plashing fountain
from which the water is conveyed to all parts of the
garden. The flower-beds are all bordered with neat edges
of stone-work, and are sunk below the irrigating channels.
Over a marble bed the waters from the fountain come rippling
down in a broad stream to a bower of bliss, where two
immense and venerable mulberry-trees cast an impenetrable
shade over a platform with seats along the entire length
of one side, protected by a balustrade projecting over the
waters of the Belus, which here runs in a clear stream, fourteen
or fifteen feet wide and two or three deep, over a pebbly
bottom, where fish of considerable size, and evidently
preserved, are darting fearlessly about, or coming up to the
steps to be fed. The stream is fringed with weeping willows,
and the spot, with its wealth of water, its thick shade,
and air fragrant with jasmine and orange blossoms, forms
an ideal retreat from the heats of summer. The sights and
sounds are all suggestive of <span id="languor">languor</span> and <i>dolce far niente</i>, of
that peculiar condition known to Orientals as <i>kief</i>, when the
senses are lulled by the sounds of murmuring water, the
odours of fragrant plants, the flickering shadows of foliage,
or the gorgeous tints of flowers and the fumes of the narghileh.
</p>

<p>
The gardener, a sedate Persian in a tall cap, who kept
the place in scrupulous order, gave us a dignified welcome.
His master, he said, would not come till the afternoon, and
if we disappeared before his arrival we were welcome to
spread our luncheon on his table under the mulberry-trees,
and sit round it on his chairs; nay, further, he even extended
his hospitality to providing us with hot water.
</p>

<p>
Thus it was that we took possession of Abbas Effendi's
garden before I had the honour of making that gentleman's
acquaintance, an act of no little audacity, when I inform
you that he claims to be the eldest son of the last incarnation
of the Deity. As his father is alive and resident at
Acre—if one may venture to talk of such a being as resident
anywhere—my anxiety to see the son was only exceeded
<span class="pageno target" title="105" id="page-105"></span>
by my curiosity to investigate the father. But this,
as I shall presently explain, seems a hope that is not likely
to be realized. Meantime I shall proceed to give you, so
far as I have been able to learn, an account of who Abbas
Effendi's father is, and all that I know about him, premising
always that I only do so subject to any modification which
further investigation may suggest.
</p>

<p>
It is now forty-eight years since a young man of three-and-twenty
appeared at the shrine of Hussein, the grandson
of the Prophet, who was made a martyr at Kerbela. He
was said to have been born at Shiraz, the son of a merchant
there, and his name was Ali Mohammed. It is supposed
that he derived his religious opinions from a certain Indian
Mussulman, called Achsai, who instituted a system of reform,
and made many disciples. Whether this is so or not,
the young Persian soon acquired a pre-eminent reputation
for sanctity, and the boldness and enthusiasm of his preaching
and the revolutionary sentiments he uttered attracted
many to his teaching. So far as I have been able to judge,
he preached a pure morality of the loftiest character, denouncing
the abuses of existing Islam as Christ did the
Judaism of his day, and fearlessly incurring the hostility of
Persian Phariseeism. A member himself of the Shiite sect
of Moslems, he sought to reform it, as being the state religion
of Persia, and finally went so far as to proclaim himself
at Kufa the <i>bab</i>, or door, through which alone man
could approach God. At the same time he announced that
he was the Mahdi, or last Imaum, who was descended from
Ali, the son-in-law of the Prophet, and whom the Shiites believe
to have been an incarnation of the Deity. Mahdi is
supposed by all Persian Moslems not to have died, but to
be awaiting in concealment the coming of the last day.
</p>

<p>
As may be imagined, the sudden appearance after so
many centuries of a reformer who claimed to be none other
than the long-expected divine manifestation, created no
little consternation throughout Persia, more especially as,
according to tradition, the time had arrived when such a
manifestation was to be looked for, and men's minds were
prepared for the event. The Persian enthusiast, as soon
as his preaching became popular and his pretensions vast,
<span class="pageno target" title="106" id="page-106"></span>
roused the most violent hostility, and he was executed at
Tabriz in 1849, after a brief career of fourteen years, at the
early age of thirty-seven. The tragic circumstances attending
his death enhanced his glory, for he was repeatedly
offered his life if he would consent to abate his claims, or
even leave the country. He preferred, however, a martyr's
crown, and was executed in the presence of a vast multitude,
leaving behind him a numerous and fanatic sect, who
have since then been known as the Babs, and whose belief
in the founder subsequent persecutions on the part of the
government have only served to confirm.
</p>

<p>
The Bab before his execution gave it to be understood
that though he was apparently about to die, he, or rather
the divine incarnation of which he was the subject, would
shortly reappear in the person of his successor, whom, I believe,
he named secretly. I do not exactly know when the
present claimant first made known his pretensions to be
that successor, but, at all events, he was universally acknowledged
by the Bab sect, now numbering some hundreds
of thousands, and became so formidable a personage, being
a man of high lineage—indeed, it is whispered that he is a
relative of the Shah himself—that he was made prisoner by
the government and sent into exile. The Sultan of Turkey
kindly undertook to provide for his incarceration, and for
some years he was a state prisoner at Adrianople. Finally
he was transported from that place to Acre, on giving his
parole to remain quietly there and not return to Persia, and
here he has been living ever since, an object of adoration to
his countrymen, who flock hither to visit him, who load him
with gifts, and over two hundred of whom remain here as
a sort of permanent body-guard.
</p>

<p>
He is visible only to women or men of the poorest class,
and obstinately refuses to let his face be seen by any man
above the rank of a fellah or peasant. Indeed, his own disciples
who visit him are only allowed a glimpse of his august
back, and in retiring from that they have to back out
with their faces towards it. I have seen a lady who has
been honoured with an interview, during which he said
nothing beyond giving her his blessing, and after about
three minutes motioned to her to retire. She describes
<span class="pageno target" title="107" id="page-107"></span>
him as a man of probably about seventy years of age, but
much younger-looking, as he dyes both his hair and his
beard black, but of a very mild and benevolent cast of
countenance. He lives at a villa in the plain, about <span id="twotwo">two</span>
miles beyond Acre, which he has rented from a Syrian
gentleman of my acquaintance, who tells me that once or
twice he has seen him walking in his garden, but that he always
turns away so that his face shall not be seen. Indeed,
the most profound secrecy is maintained in regard to him
and the religious tenets of his sect.
</p>

<p>
Not long ago, however, public curiosity was gratified, for
one of his Persian followers stabbed another for having
been unworthy of some religious trust, and the great man
himself was summoned as a witness.
</p>

<p>
“Will you tell the court who and what you are?” was
the first question put.
</p>

<p>
“I will begin,” he replied, “by telling you who I am not.
I am not a camel driver”—this was an allusion to the Prophet
Mohammed—“nor am I the son of a carpenter”—this
in allusion to Christ. “This is as much as I can tell you
to-day. If you will now let me retire, I will tell you to-morrow
who I am.”
</p>

<p>
Upon this promise he was let go; but the morrow never
came. With an enormous bribe he had in the interval purchased
an exemption from all further attendance at court.
</p>

<p>
That his wealth is fabulous may be gathered from the
fact that not long since a Persian emir or prince, possessing
large estates, came and offered them all, if in return he
would only allow him to fill his water-jars. The offer was
considered worthy of acceptance, and the emir is at this
moment a gardener in the grounds which I saw over the
wall of my friend's villa. This is only one instance of the
devotion with which he is regarded, and of the honours
which are paid to him: indeed, when we remember that he
is believed to possess the attributes of Deity, this is not to
be wondered at. Meantime his disciples are patiently waiting
for his turn to come, which will be on the last day,
when his divine character will be recognized by unbelievers.

<a href="#toc-22">AN ANCIENT JEWISH COMMUNITY.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, Nov. 25.—In one of the most remote and secluded
valleys in the mountains of northern Galilee lies a village,
the small population of which possesses an interest altogether
unique. As I looked down upon it from the precipitous and
dangerous path by means of which I was skirting the flank
of the mountain, I thought I had rarely seen a spot of such
ideal beauty. It was an oasis, not actually in a desert—for
the rocky mountain ranges were covered with wild herbage—but
in a savage wilderness of desolation, in the midst of
which the village nestled in a forest of orange, almond, fig,
and pomegranate trees, the tiny rills of water by which they
were irrigated glistening like silver threads in the sunlight,
and the yellow crops beyond contrasting with the dull
green of the hill verdure, long deprived of water, and the
gray rocks which reared their craggy pinnacles above it.
</p>

<p>
The name of this village was Bukeia. I had heard vaguely
of the existence of a spot in Galilee where a community of
Jews lived who claimed to be the descendants of families
who had tilled the land in this same locality prior to the destruction
of Jerusalem and the subsequent dispersion of the
race; as it had never been suspected that any remnant
of the nation had clung to the soil of their fathers from
time immemorial, and as it is certain that this is the only
remnant that has, I took some trouble to ascertain the name
of the village, and felt that it was worth a pilgrimage to
visit it. Although hitherto unknown to Europeans and
tourists, it has been for many years a spot much frequented
by the Jews of Safed and Tiberias, and this summer especially,
when the cholera panic prevailed in the country, there
was a perfect rush of the wealthier Jews and rabbis of those
towns to its pure air and bracing climate. In a small way
it is a sort of Jewish sanatorium.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="109" id="page-109"></span>
</div>

<p>
But the village does not consist altogether of Jews. In
fact, they form the minority of the population, which is composed
of eighty Druse, forty Greek-Christian, and twenty
Jewish families, the latter numbering about one hundred and
twenty souls in all. Refusing the invitation of the Druse
and Christian sheiks to accept their hospitality, I listened
rather to the solicitations of the elderly Hebrew who eagerly
placed his house at my disposal, and was the patriarch of
his coreligionists, his local title being, like those of the heads
of the other communities, that of sheik. His house was a
stone erection with a court-yard, and contained a single large
room, which, as is common in Arab houses, afforded eating
and sleeping accommodation for the whole family. On this
occasion it soon became crowded to excess.
</p>

<p>
First appeared the Druse sheik, with white turban, and
composed and dignified bearing. Then the sheik of the
Christians, a man in no way to be distinguished from the ordinary
type of native fellahin; then the Greek priest, in his
high, round-topped black hat and long black coat, reaching
nearly to his feet; then the Jewish rabbi, who officiates at
the synagogue, in flowing Eastern robe; then some village
notables of all three religions, who all squatted on mats,
forming a semicircle, of which my friends and I were the
centre, and which involved a large demand upon our host
for coffee, for on these occasions it is a great breach of politeness
not to furnish all the uninvited guests who flock in
to see distinguished strangers with that invariable beverage.
When one or two Moslems, who were temporary visitors to
the village, dropped in from curiosity, I could not fail to be
struck with the singular ethnological and theological compound
by which I was surrounded. Here, in these Christian
and Moslem peasants, were the descendants of those ancient
Canaanites whom the conquering Jews failed to drive out
of the country during the entire period of their occupation
of it, though they doubtless served their conquerors as hewers
of wood and drawers of water, and as farm-servants
generally; for the result of the most recent and exhaustive
research proves, I think, incontestably that the fellahin of
Palestine, taken as a whole, are the modern representatives
of those old tribes which the Israelites found settled in the
<span class="pageno target" title="110" id="page-110"></span>
country, such as the Canaanites, Hivites, Jebusites, Amorites,
Philistines, Edomites. In what proportion these various
tribes are now represented, whether they were preceded
by a still older autochthonous population, namely, the Anakim,
Horites, and so forth, are questions which have so far
been beyond the reach of scientific research. But though
this race, or rather conglomeration of races, which may be
designated for want of a better by the vague title of pre-Israelite,
still survives beneath the Mohammedan or Christian
exterior, it has not remained uninfluenced during the
lapse of centuries by the many events and circumstances that
have happened in Palestine.
</p>

<p>
Each successive change in the social and political condition
of the country has more or less affected it in various ways,
and we must not be surprised when studying the fellahin
at finding Jewish, Hellenic, Rabbinic, Christian, and Mussulman
reminiscences mingled pell-mell, and in the quaintest
combinations, with traits which may bring us back to the
most remote and obscure periods of pre-Israelite existence.
Indeed, for anything one could say to the contrary, the
Christian fellahin of this village, though they had resisted
the proselytizing efforts of the Saracen conquest in the sixth
century, may, before they were converted to Christianity,
have worshipped the gods of the Græco-Roman period; before
that they may have been Jews, for there can be little
question that the aboriginal population, to some extent,
adopted the Jewish faith after the conquest, and before that
were worshippers of the Syro-Phœnician deities, Baal and
Ashtaroth. They may in those old times, when Jewish
power was supreme, have been in this very village the servants
of the ancestors of these very Jews who now share its
land with them, as they had, according to their traditions,
done from the most ancient period; and this means, in a
country where genealogies are preserved for centuries upon
centuries, a very long time ago. I have a friend at Haifa
who says he can trace his ancestry back to the crusades,
when his family was resident at the old town of the same
name; and, as a grotesque illustration of their pretensions, a
story is told of a Bedouin sheik who, being asked whether
he was descended from Abraham, said that he could trace
<span class="pageno target" title="111" id="page-111"></span>
further back, and that, in fact, Abraham was not a sheik of
a very good family.
</p>

<p>
The only really modern intruders in the group by which
I was surrounded were the Druses, who only settled in the
village about three hundred years ago, and whose origin
prior to nine hundred years ago, when we know that they
were settled at Aleppo, is rather obscure; but it is generally
believed that they were originally a tribe inhabiting the
province of Yemen. Here, too, in this small group of Arabic-speaking
people, were represented four of the most widely
divergent religions. There were the two Moslems,
whose ancestors, probably, prior to the conquest of Palestine
by the Saracens, had been Christians, but had then adopted
the faith of the Prophet. There was the priest of the Greek
Church, still clinging to the dogmas which he inherited
from the first Christians—the descendant, possibly, of one
who had actually listened to the words of Christ and his
disciples, in the country which their posterity has never left.
And indeed it is a curious reflection in looking at these fellahin
to think that they may be the direct descendants of
some of those thousands who were influenced at the time
by the teaching which has since swayed the moral sentiment
of civilized humanity. Then there were the Jews—the only
group of Jews existing in the world whose ancestors have
clung to the soil ever since that Teacher's tragic death, and
whose fathers may have shared in the general hostility to
him at the time—representing still the faith which was the
repository of the highest moral teaching prior to Christianity,
prior to Mohammedanism. Lastly, there were the
Druses, in whose esoteric religion is to be found the most
extraordinary confusion of metaphysical notions, gnostic and
pagan, the outcome of a mystical interweaving of ideas derived
from the most divergent faiths, with a Magian or Zoroastrian
basis, upon which Hindoo and Buddhist, Jewish
and Platonic, Christian and Moslem dogmas have been successively
grafted, forming a system so recondite and abstruse
that only the initiated can comprehend it, if indeed
they can.
</p>

<p>
Such were the mixed religious and race conditions by
which I was surrounded, and I was much struck by the apparent
<span class="pageno target" title="112" id="page-112"></span>
tolerance and amiability with which all the members
of these different religions regarded each other. The Jewish
rabbi told me privately that he much preferred Druses
to Christians; but he lived on good terms with all. And
when I went to see the synagogue the Greek priest strolled
round with me, and the rabbi returned the compliment by
accompanying us when I went to visit the little Greek
church. Meantime, the Hebrew sheik had summoned all
the Jewish population, and they came trooping in to perform
the usual Eastern salutation of kissing the hand. Old men
and maidens, young men and married women and children,
I saw them all, nor, so far as dress and facial type were
concerned, was it possible to distinguish them from the fellahin
of the country generally. These twenty families
seemed all to have descended from one stock, they all had
the same name, Cohen, and they have never intermarried
either with the people of the country or even with other
Jews. I afterwards had some conversation with the Christian
and Druse sheiks in regard to them. They said that
formerly more of the village lands belonged to them, but
owing to the wars, pestilences, and other misfortunes which
had overtaken the country at various times, their property
had become diminished; indeed, there can be little doubt
that the Druses themselves, when Fakr Eddin conquered
this part of the country, appropriated some of it; so that now,
so far as their worldly circumstances go, the Jews are badly
off. Nevertheless they do not complain, and are skilful,
hard-working, and persevering agriculturists, to my mind
more deserving of sympathy than many of their coreligionists
who have come to settle in the country as colonists, depending
more upon the assistance which they derive from
without than upon their own efforts. The experience and
example of their coreligionists at Bukeia would make the
neighbourhood of that place a desirable locality for a colony.
</p>

<p>
From Bukeia I followed a northwesterly direction, by a
most picturesque mountain path, and in a few hours reached
the romantically situated town of Tershiha, where I was
most hospitably entertained by the Cadi, a dignified Arab
gentleman of a true old Oriental type which is now becoming
<span class="pageno target" title="113" id="page-113"></span>
rare. This place contains about two thousand inhabitants.
They are nearly all the adherents of a certain sheik,
Ali el-Mograbi, a Moslem reformer, who emigrated to this
place from the north of Africa many years ago, and whose
preaching has been attended with remarkable success. As
his fame grew he moved to Acre, where he exercises an extraordinary
influence. The tenets of the sect of which he
is the head are kept a profound secret, though there is nothing
to distinguish the worship of the initiated from that of
any ordinary sect of howling dervishes, to the outside observer,
except the sparing use of the name of Mohammed.
It is said, however, that their views are latitudinarian, and,
that, so far from being exclusive or fanatic, are rather in the
sense of extreme toleration for other religions. Whatever
be the nature of their heterodoxy, it is not now interfered
with. Indeed, it is hinted that the sheik counts among his
followers some of the most highly placed officials in the empire,
and there can be little doubt that his doctrines are
spreading rapidly among Moslems, while even Christians
have joined the society. A large new mosque is now in
progress of erection at Haifa. The sheik himself, whose
acquaintance I made subsequently, is now a very old man,
regarded with the most extreme veneration by his followers,
and the results of his teaching prove that he must be endowed
with gifts of a very high order.

<a href="#toc-23">DOMESTIC LIFE AMONG THE SYRIANS.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, March 1, 1884.—The ordinary tourists in Palestine
who write books of their experience have so little opportunity
of knowing the conditions which surround the daily
life of a resident in a small country town, that a few details
of domestic existence here, as contrasted with those of more
civilized countries, may not be uninteresting. As a general
rule, the foreigner who comes to a native town to settle down
as a permanent inhabitant finds himself compelled more or
less to adopt the manners and customs of the richer class of
Syrians, which gives him an opportunity of becoming acquainted
with their home life. Some of these are wealthy
merchants or large landed proprietors, with incomes varying
from $5000 to $15,000, though a man whose yearly revenue
reached the latter amount, of which he would not spend half,
would be considered a millionaire, and few small towns can
boast of so great a capitalist. As, owing to the march of
civilization, the richer classes have of late years taken to
travel and the study of languages, persons occupying this
position generally speak either French or Italian, have visited
Paris, Constantinople, or Alexandria, and have a thin varnish
of European civilization overlaying their native barbarism.
</p>

<p>
The rich families of the Syrian aristocracy are almost invariably
Christians, but they have only recently shaken off
the manners of their Mohammedan neighbours and conquerors.
The women associate far more freely than they
used to do with the men. They now no longer cover their
faces, and although they still wear the “fustan,” or white
winding-sheet, which serves as cloak and head-dress in one,
it nearly always conceals a dress of European make, while,
instead of bare feet thrust into slippers, they have Paris bottines
and stockings. The men of this class also dress in
European garments, wearing, however, the red fez cap.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="115" id="page-115"></span>
</div>

<p>
The domestic arrangements of a family of this description
are by no means so refined in character as the external aspect
of the house and its proprietor, when he is taking his
exercise on a gorgeously caparisoned Arab horse, would suggest.
If we are on sufficiently intimate terms with him to
stay as a guest in his house, we find that his pretty wife,
with her Paris dress and dainty chaussure, walks about in
the privacy of the domestic home with bare, or at best stockinged,
feet, thrust into high wooden pattens, with which she
clatters over the handsome marble hall that forms the central
chamber of the house, slipping out her feet and leaving the
pattens at the door of any of the rooms she may be about to
enter. She wears a loose morning-wrapper, which she is not
particular about buttoning, but in this respect she is outdone
by sundry dishevelled maid-servants, who also clatter about
the house in pattens and in light garments that seem to require
very little fastening in front. As for the husband,
who, when he called upon you, might have come off the boulevards
of Paris, barring always the red cap, he has now reverted
absolutely into the Oriental. He wears a long white
and not unbecoming garment that reaches from his throat to
his heels, and his feet are thrust into red slippers. As he
sips his matutinal cup of coffee and smokes his first narghileh
of the day, there is nothing about him to remind you that he
knows a word of any other language than Arabic, or has ever
worn any other costume than that of his Eastern ancestors.
He is sitting in his own little den, with his feet tucked under
him on the divan which runs around the room, and with his
wife in close proximity, her feet tucked under her, and also
smoking a narghileh and sipping coffee.
</p>

<p>
Yet, if you call upon this worthy couple as a distinguished
foreigner, in the afternoon, accompanied by your wife, and
are not on intimate terms, you are received in a room which
they never enter, except upon such state occasions, by the
same gentleman, in a perfectly fitting black frock-coat and
trousers, varnished boots, and a white waistcoat, and by the
same lady, in a dress which has been made in Paris.
</p>

<p>
The furniture consists of massive tables with marble tops,
and handsome arm-chairs and couches covered with costly
satins. The walls are resplendent with gilt mirrors and with
<span class="pageno target" title="116" id="page-116"></span>
heavy hanging curtains. The floors are covered with rich
carpets. There is a three-hundred-dollar piano, on which the
lady never plays; and there are pictures, of which the frames
are more artistic than the subjects—the whole having the air
of a show repository of some sort. Indeed, if your host is at
all taken by surprise, the first thing he does is to open all
the shutters, as, except upon such occasions, the apartment is
one of silent and absolute gloom. He has a guest-chamber,
also furnished after a civilized style, in which he puts you,
if you are going to stay with him, and he has so far adopted
civilized habits that he sleeps on a bed himself, and not on
mats on the floor, like his forefathers. His dinner is served
on a table, which is spread as he has seen it spread in the
houses of foreigners, but he retains the native cooking, the
huge pillaw of rice, the chicken stew with rich and greasy
gravy, the lamb stuffed with pistachio nuts, the leben or sour
milk, the indescribable sweet dishes, crisp, sticky, and nutty,
the delicious preserves of citrons, dates, and figs, the flat
bread and the goat cheese, and the wine of the country.
</p>

<p>
Altogether, he gives you plenty to eat, drink, and smoke,
but his conversational powers and ideas are limited, which
is not to be wondered at, considering that there is not a
book in the house. He tells you that the house cost him
$9000, which does not seem likely to be an exaggeration
when we look at the handsome marble floors and staircase,
massive arches, and the extent of ground which is covered by
spacious halls and ample courts.
</p>

<p>
The kitchen and offices, if you have the curiosity to look
into them, are filthy in the extreme, and the process of cooking
the dinner, performed by a slovenly female, had better
not be too closely examined. His domestic establishment
probably consists of four women and two or three men who
look after the stables, in which are three or four handsome
horses, and a garden requiring constant attention. He has no
wheeled vehicle, for there are no roads. The women rarely
take any other exercise than that of waddling on gossiping
visits to each other, when their conversation turns entirely
on domestic subjects, on the marital traits of their respective
husbands, on congratulations on the arrival of children, if
they are boys, and condolences if they are girls, and on hopeful
<span class="pageno target" title="117" id="page-117"></span>
speculation and encouragement if there are none at all;
for of all misfortunes which can befall a Syrian lady, to be
childless is the greatest. If there are grown-up daughters
they are carefully protected from intimacy with young men,
and marriages are arranged by the parents. The chances of
making a good match depend more on the amount of the
marriage-settlement than on their looks. If the family happens
to be a large one it is not uncommon to see a young
lady who has been brought up in what, in Syria, is considered
luxury, married to some poor and distant connection,
whose family live in the humblest manner. In such a case
the contrast is greater than can be imagined in our country.
She is transferred from the palatial residence I have described
to a one-storied house which probably does not consist
of more than two rooms, and where her husband's family
live in the old style. Here she is received, perhaps, by
his mother and sister, with whom she is to live; who wear
the pure native costume; who have never had a shoe or
stocking on in their lives; who sleep on mats on the floor,
for there are no bedsteads; who partake of their meals squatting
on their heels, for there are no chairs or tables; and
who eat with their fingers, for there are no knives and forks.
</p>

<p>
If the newly married couple do not occupy the same room
with the rest of the family, they share the other one with
the domestic animals. These probably consist of a horse, a
cow, and a donkey. For the sake of security they are stabled
in the room of the master of the house. Their manger is on
a level with the floor on which he and his bride sleep. I
have before now shared such a room with a young married
couple—she, the daughter of a wealthy man who lived in
civilized style—and all night I have been disturbed by the
crunching of the animals feeding within a few feet of where
I was lying; with their constant rising up and lying down;
with the movements of my host and hostess, who would get
up constantly in the night, sometimes to feed the animals,
which were required for work before sunrise, sometimes to
replenish the charcoal fire, sometimes to attend to the baby,
or to open the door and hold a whispered conference with
some nocturnal visitor. As there is no undressing on going
to bed, among these people, and as they indulge in long
<span class="pageno target" title="118" id="page-118"></span>
snoozes during the day, the night does not seem to be so
especially devoted to sleep as with us. They appear to
think that, as going to bed simply consists in lying down
on the floor in your clothes, one part of the twenty-four
hours will do as well for sleep as another, and their nights
are restless accordingly. As a general rule, for persons
who have not been long enough in the country to get
used to insects, the nights are made restless from other
causes.
</p>

<p>
It is curious, in the case of such a marriage as I have
described, to see the change which takes place when the
young wife leaves the retired village to which she has been
banished, owing to the impoverished circumstances of her husband,
to pay a visit to her own family. I scarcely recognize
her when I meet her again. When last I saw her in her
humble home her costume consisted of a thin sort of chemisette,
a pair of full, baggy trousers fastened at the knee,
leaving the legs and feet bare, and over these a skirt, and we
were dipping our fingers amicably into the same dish of rice.
Now I would walk down Broadway with her on my arm, and
be rather proud of her fashionable “get up” than otherwise;
and she handles her knife and fork with far greater dexterity
than I did my fingers.
</p>

<p>
The wave of civilization is, however, rapidly encroaching
upon these humbler classes. It is only natural that a girl
brought up in this way should endeavour to introduce innovations
into her husband's home. Within the last few
years there has been a marked change in this respect, particularly
in a town like Haifa, where the Christian population
largely predominates. A veiled face is rarely to be seen,
while women, even of the poorer classes, are introducing the
fashion of wearing gowns, adding a table and a few chairs
to their domestic furniture, and have even gone the length
of sleeping on bedsteads, though I have not yet pried sufficiently
into nocturnal mysteries to know whether, when
they go to bed, they have progressed in civilization so far as
to undress.

<a href="#toc-24">FISHING ON LAKE TIBERIAS.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, April 2.—I have just returned from a trip into
the interior, during which I have been exploring some new
and interesting country. Instead of following the usual
road to the eastward by way of the valley of Esdraelon, I
struck in a northeasterly direction across the fertile plain
of Acre, fording the Kishon at the point of its debouchure
into the sea, where, after the winter rains, we are generally
obliged to swim the horses, while we cross ourselves in a ferry-boat.
In two hours from this point we strike the first low
range of the Galilee hills, at a depression from which, in the
times of the crusaders, the armies of Saladin used to issue
forth to give them battle. Indeed, the whole ground over
which we ride has been from time immemorial the scene of
bloody warfare, and it is not impossible, considering how
events are shaping themselves in the East, that it may become
so again. Rising gently, by grassy vales carpeted
with wild flowers, to a height of about five hundred feet,
we shortly reach the picturesquely situated town of Shefr
Amr, dominated by the extensive walls of its ruined
castle.
</p>

<p>
This has been a place of considerable importance ever
since, shortly after the destruction of Jerusalem, it was the
seat of the Jewish sanhedrim. It was then called Shefaram,
and is probably identical with the Kefraim which Eusebius
says was six miles north of Legio, and with Hapraim, which
we read in the Bible was assigned to the tribe of Issachar.
Since then its name has been changed to Shefr Amr, or “the
healing of Omar,” from a tradition that Daher el-Amr, a
prince who governed this country about a hundred and
sixty years ago, recovered here from a severe illness. The
fortress is said to have been built by his son Othman in
1761, and it does not appear to be older, though probably it
<span class="pageno target" title="120" id="page-120"></span>
occupies the site of a much more ancient castle. It covers
a very extensive area of ground, with crenellated battlements,
and contains stalls for four hundred horses. It is now
partly ruined, but a portion of it is still sufficiently well
preserved to be the residence of the Mudir, or local governor.
</p>

<p>
I scrambled by a most dilapidated stone stair to the top
of the walls, and had a magnificent view over the surrounding
country. The position is so commanding that I could
well understand why Saladin chose it as a point from which
he could harass the Franks who were besieging Acre, which
town was plainly visible in the distance. I was informed
that the whole of this extensive fortress was offered by the
government for sale for $1500. The stones alone would be
worth more than this amount, if it were not for the cost of
transport, to say nothing of the area of land which they
cover. But, as a matter of speculation, Barnum's pink-and-white
elephant would be about as convenient a possession
for a private individual. It is no wonder that it has been
for some time in the market, or that the town itself, when
capital is so scarce, should be a sleepy looking, stagnant
place. Still, it is better built than the average; the houses
are generally constructed of stone—many of them are of two
stories—there is a fair bazaar, and a population of about
two thousand five hundred inhabitants, of which fifteen
hundred are Greek Christians, three hundred Moslems, six
hundred Druses, and the remainder Jews. Some thirty families
of Morocco Jews settled here as agriculturists about
the year 1850, but after struggling against extortion for
twenty years they had to give it up, and the colony is now
extinct, the Jews now here being natives of the country.
The Druse population is also rapidly diminishing from the
same cause; a slow but steady migration takes place annually
to the Druse mountains to the east of the Hauran,
where they are practically independent of government control;
there are also a few Protestants here, with a schoolhouse,
besides a convent and church of the Roman Catholic
nuns (Dames de Nazareth), built in 1866, with a girls'
school.
</p>

<p>
The only other interesting building at Shefr Amr is the
<span class="pageno target" title="121" id="page-121"></span>
Greek church, which has been rebuilt on old foundations.
The remains were evidently Byzantine work, dating probably
from the fifth or sixth century. Many interesting tombs
are to be found both north and south of the town. The
most noteworthy has a handsome façade, covered with a design
of a vine with grapes in bold relief, and with small figures
of birds introduced. Each vine-plant grows out of a
pot. On each side of the door is an effaced Greek inscription,
with rosettes in lozenges below and birds above.
Here, also, are fragments of Greek inscriptions, and on the
left side-wall of the vestibule is a bas-relief of a lion and a
small animal, perhaps a cub; on the right a lion, a cub, and
a bird. The drawing is very primitive, and has a Byzantine
appearance. Inside this tomb, which contains three
loculi, there are mouldings round the principal arch, with
tracery of vines and carvings of birds. These tombs are interesting
because both the inscriptions and ornamentation
belong to the Byzantine period, thus proving that the mode
of sepulture practised by the Jews from the most remote
date was continued by the Christians up to the fifth or
sixth century after Christ.
</p>

<p>
Our way from Shefr Amr led through the beautiful oak
woods which belong to that town, but which seem doomed
to destruction, for I observed that many of the handsomest
trees were girdled near the base, while numerous stumps
bore testimony to this lamentable work of denudation. In
a country where wood is becoming so rare it was heartbreaking
to ride through this beautiful, park-like scenery
and witness the work of destruction going on in spite of the
government prohibition against felling timber. Emerging
from these grassy glades we descend into the magnificent
plain of the Buttauf, now a sheet of emerald green, as the
young crops extend before us as far as the eye can reach.
Traversing this fertile country one is more and more impressed
with the incorrectness of the judgment of the ordinary tourist,
who, confining himself to the route prescribed by Cook,
is taken through the barren hills of Judea, and to one or
two holy places in Galilee, and then goes home and talks
about the waste and desolation of Palestine. The trite saying
recurred to my mind as I looked on this wealth of grain:
<span class="pageno target" title="122" id="page-122"></span>
“I pity the man who can go from Dan to Beersheba and
say that all is barren;” or, as my travelling-companion,
who was an American, more forcibly put it: “If ever I
meet a tourist who tells me that Palestine is barren, I'll
lick him.”
</p>

<p>
But we were not on the tourist track, and it was not till we
reached Tiberias that we found specimens, and they were
too discreet; in their remarks to give my friend an opportunity
of expressing his views in the manner contemplated.
Here we took a boat and crossed the lake. I wanted to investigate
the present fishing capabilities of these waters, but
I soon found that I had not the appropriate tackle. The
natives either fish with circular hand-nets, which they throw
with great dexterity, or with long hand-lines, which they
bait with small dead fish and haul in, thus trawling in a
rough way. They have no idea of fishing with a rod, and
mine came to grief, so that I had no opportunity of casting
a fly, but I think it not unlikely, from the way I saw the
fish jumping towards evening, that they would rise to it.
The natives catch their bait by poisoning the water with
pinches of a powder which they throw in near the margin.
In a few moments the minnows and small fish are to be seen
swimming lazily along the surface, completely stupefied, and
one has only to put one's hand in and take them out. The
fish we caught were principally of the bass or perch species,
averaging half a pound or more each. One of the boatmen
caught a dozen with two or three casts of the hand-net, but
it was useless to try with a rod without proper tackle. I
am convinced that a spinning artificial minnow, or a copper
spoon, would be very killing; so, of course, would be trawling
live bait, but the natives know only their own primitive
style of fishing, and the idea of a rod and line, even with
the common angle-worm at one end and a fool at the other,
was entirely new to them. Indeed, scarcely any fish are
taken from the lake. There are only four boats on it, but
these are used more for transport than fishing purposes, and
the population is so sparse on the shores that there is no demand.
We were assured by our boatmen, however, that
they occasionally took fish over five feet in length, and I
have seen enough of what may be done to decide me to go
<span class="pageno target" title="123" id="page-123"></span>
there again some day properly provided, instead of relying
on native appliances.
</p>

<p>
The spot at which we were moored on the eastern shore
of the lake was immediately under a precipitous conical-shaped
hill, which rose abruptly to a height of twelve hundred
feet from the waters. Its summit was crowned with
the ruins of the ancient city of Gamala. The modern name
for it is Kalat el-Hosn, but it owes its ancient appellation
to its shape, which is exactly that of a camel's hump. It is
interesting as having been a purely Jewish fortification, the
last that was sacked by Vespasian and Titus before the
siege of Jerusalem, and it has remained to this day exactly
as they left it. Josephus gives a very graphic account of
the siege, which took place in the last days of September,
sixty-nine years after the birth of Christ. Owing to the
precipices by which it was surrounded it was supposed to
be impregnable, and when, at last, after a twenty-nine
days' siege, it was found not to be so, the whole population
who had survived its horrors, consisting of five thousand
men, women, and children, flung themselves into the
yawning gulf below the ramparts, thus perishing by their
own act. Of the entire population only two women escaped
alive.
</p>

<p>
When we compare the fighting of those days with the
siege of Paris, for instance, where the population surrendered
because there was a little too much sawdust in the
bread, the results of modern as contrasted with ancient civilization
suggest some curious reflections. That the civilization
of those days was of a high order is attested by the
magnificent remains which still exist in Gamala. Here are
to be found, strewn over the ground, some thirty huge
granite columns, which must have been transported from
Egypt to this giddy height by engineering contrivances
which would puzzle the science of these days, and Corinthian
capitals neatly cut in hard, black basalt, and sarcophagi
and other monuments, all evidencing a high state
of art.
</p>

<p>
These ruins have hitherto been only superficially examined,
and there can be no doubt that the investigations of
the Palestine Exploration Fund, when the society is permitted
<span class="pageno target" title="124" id="page-124"></span>
by the Turkish government to prosecute their researches
to the east of the Jordan, will bring many interesting
treasures to light. I only regretted that I had no time
to give to these ruins, as my objective point lay farther to
the south and east.

<a href="#toc-25">A VISIT TO THE SULPHUR SPRINGS OF AMATHA.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, April 15.—At the spot where the Jordan issues
from Lake Tiberias there are two large mounds, a fragment
of sea-wall, and a causeway on arches which projects into the
river, dividing it from the waters of the lake, and suggesting
that it may possibly, in ancient times, have formed the
approach to a bridge. There is no bridge there now. The
river swirls round the arches, which are choked with ruins
and reeds, and in a broad, swift stream winds its way to the
Dead Sea. Here, in old time, stood the Roman city of Tarichæa,
built on the site of a Phœnician fortress of still older
date. Nothing remains but heaps of rubbish covered with
broken pottery, and fragments of sculpture; but it offers,
probably, a rich field for future excavation. The modern
name Kerak signifies in Syriac “fortress,” and its natural
position was remarkably strong, as the Jordan, after leaving
the lake, takes a sharp bend to the westward and flows almost
parallel with it, thus leaving an intervening peninsula
on which the town was situated. It was defended on the
westward by a broad ditch, traces of which still remain, connecting
the Jordan with the lake, thus making the peninsula
an island approached only by a causeway.
</p>

<p>
Josephus mentions Tarichæa as having been an important
military post in the wars of his time. When I visited it the
lake was unusually high, and the Jordan was unfordable, so
we were obliged to ferry over, swimming our horses and mules
a distance of seventy or eighty yards across the rapid current.
Then we mounted, and galloped in a southeasterly direction,
over a fertile plain, waving at this season of the year with
luxuriant crops. I was so much struck with the fertility and
agricultural capacity of this region that I made inquiry as
to its ownership, and found that it had been presented by a
former sultan to one of the principal Bedouin sheiks of this
<span class="pageno target" title="126" id="page-126"></span>
Eastern country, and that he was exempt from all taxation.
His lands extend to the foothills, where the Yarmuk issues
from the mountains of Gilead and Jaulan, which we were
now approaching. We had ascended these but a little way
when a scene burst upon us which surprised and delighted
us by its wild and unexpected grandeur. The Yarmuk here
enters the plain of the Jordan on its way to join that river,
with a volume of water fully equal to the latter, pouring its
swollen torrent between two perfectly perpendicular precipices
of basalt, which are about two hundred yards apart,
and look like some majestic gateway expressly designed by
nature to afford the river a fitting outlet to the plain after
its wild course through the mountains.
</p>

<p>
On each side of these cliffs the country swells back abruptly
to a height of seventeen hundred feet above the stream.
At their base, here and there, the limestone or basalt rock, for
the two formations are curiously intermixed, crops out sharply,
forming terraces with precipitous sides. The more distant
summits are fringed with oak forests. The general effect
of the landscape, as you first burst upon it after leaving the
Jordan valley, is in the highest degree impressive. The path,
gradually ascending, winds along the edge of cliffs, rising to
a sheer height of three hundred feet from the torrent which
foams beneath. We are so close to their margin on the
right that it makes us giddy to look down, while on the left
hand grassy slopes, covered with wild flowers, rise to the
base of other cliffs above us. For an hour we wind along
these dizzy ledges. In one place I observed a hundred feet
of limestone superimposed upon two hundred of basalt, the
whole forming a black-and-white precipice very remarkable
to look upon. In fact, my further investigations of this
valley of the Yarmuk, some portion of which, I believe, we
were the first to explore, have convinced me that it affords
finer scenery than is to be found in any other part of Palestine.
It is astonishing that it should have remained until
now almost entirely unknown. Where the valley opened a
little we saw beneath us a small plain, almost encircled by
the river, and on it about twenty Bedouin tents. Our unexpected
and novel appearance on the cliff above evidently
caused some little stir and amazement, but they were too far
<span class="pageno target" title="127" id="page-127"></span>
below us to communicate with, so we pushed on to a point
where the path suddenly plunged down by a series of steps
between walls of black basalt, making a very steep descent
for loaded mules, and one not altogether pleasant for mounted
men. It had the advantage of bringing us soon to the bottom,
however, but not before my eyes were gladdened by
the sight of one of the objects for which I had undertaken
the trip.
</p>

<p>
At my feet, and separated from the river by a narrow
strip of land covered with bushes, was a long pool of bluish-gray
water, in marked contrast with the yellow stream.
Above it floated a very light mist, or, rather, haze. Following
with the eye a little stream of the same coloured water
which entered it, past a primitive mill, I saw that it debouched
from another pond similar in colour, and evidently
its source, and to this our path was conducting us. It was
the first of the hot sulphur springs of Amatha, celebrated
by Eusebius as being much frequented in the time of the
Romans, and famous for their healing qualities. We soon
reached its margin, and, dismounting, tethered our horses
under the shade of a large tree, and stretched ourselves for
a rest after our ride, preparatory to a slight repast and a
more minute investigation of the springs and the ruins by
which they are surrounded. Our nostrils were regaled by a
strong odour of rotten eggs, which left no doubt in our
minds as to the quality of the water in the immediate neighborhood.
We were here at a depression of five hundred and
fifty feet below the surface of the sea, but the climate, which
must be intolerably hot in summer, was at this time of year
delightful. We were soon sufficiently rested to scramble
down to the pool, only a few yards below us, which was about
fifty yards long by thirty broad, and apparently five or six feet
deep. The temperature was 98°, and the taste of the water
very strongly sulphurous. Then we ascended a mound behind,
covered with ruins, consisting principally of fragments
of columns, carved stone seats, and drafted blocks which
had been used for building purposes. Immediately behind
this mound was an extensive ruin, consisting of three arches
in a fair state of preservation. Two of the arches were fifteen
or twenty feet high, and enclosed a semicircular space
<span class="pageno target" title="128" id="page-128"></span>
or hall for bathers. On the other side was a vaulted building
which partly enclosed what is at this day the only frequented
spring. This is a circular pool. Part of the old
masonry which enclosed it still remains. The pool is about
twenty-five feet wide, with a temperature so high that I found
it impossible to keep my hand in it. To my great astonishment,
and to theirs also when they saw me suddenly appear,
four or five Arabs were bathing in it. How their bodies
could support the heat was to me a mystery. They did not
support it long. They were no sooner in than out, their
bodies looking as much like lobsters as the complexion of
their skins would permit. They laughed, and invited me to
join them. One or two were stretched full length on the
identical stone slabs under the building on which, doubtless,
two thousand years ago, the bathers of that date used to repose
after having been half boiled alive.
</p>

<p>
This spring must be of immense volume, to judge by the
size of the torrent which gushed from it, and which was
crossed on stepping-stones, flowing away in what would be
considered a good-sized trout stream, to mingle its waters
with the Yarmuk after a course of a few hundred yards.
We determined, when our tents arrived, to pitch them near
this spring, on the brink of another stream which flowed
in from the eastward, and which, though slightly sulphurous,
was drinkable. Indeed, we did not object to taking a
moderate amount of this wholesome medicament into our
organisms. We found another strong spring, not quite so
hot as the one in use, a little above our tents, so that there
is no lack of water. Indeed, I doubt whether sulphur springs
of so much volume exist anywhere else in the world. Not
far from this, with its back to another mound, were the ruins
of an old Roman theatre, some of the rows of seats still
clearly discernible.
</p>

<p>
These springs are situated on a plain about a mile long
and half a mile broad, semicircular in shape, the chord of the
arc consisting of a line of basalt precipices, from which it
slopes gradually to the river, which forms the bow. It is
watered by a good fresh-water spring, which rushes from
the base of the cliffs. The hot sulphur stream which issues
from the pool we first visited turns a mill and then flows into
<span class="pageno target" title="129" id="page-129"></span>
the long, oblong pond I first saw from above. Here, after
the exertions of the day, I determined to bathe. I never
enjoyed a swim more than the one in this soft sulphur water,
with a temperature of 95°. The pool was about one hundred
yards long and ten wide, and out of my depth nearly throughout
its length. The rocks, upon which I could sit comfortably
up to my neck, where the stream entered the pool were
covered with a heavy white deposit. The sensation afterwards
was one of delicious languor; but my full enjoyment
of the bath was a little marred by the fact that I had to
walk a quarter of a mile back to the tents afterwards. I had
a long talk on my way, to the miller, the solitary resident of
this lonely but enchanting spot, and tried to induce him to
desert the mill, of which he was the guardian, and act as my
guide up the river on the following day; but he was either
too conscientious, too lazy, or too ignorant—I suspect the
latter, as I found by experience that all the information he
gave me of a topographical nature was utterly erroneous.
It was, therefore, with a pleasing sense of anticipation that
we retired to rest, determined to trust to our own geographical
instincts alone for our proposed exploration.

<a href="#toc-26">EXPLORATION OF THE VALLEY OF THE
YARMUK.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, April 30.—In my last letter I described the little-known
hot sulphur springs of Amatha, with their extensive
ruins, which indicate the celebrity they must have acquired
in the days of the Romans. As the river Yarmuk above
this point had, so far as I know, never been explored, I determined
to push up the gorges through which it cleaves its
way from the highlands of the Hauran to the valley of the
Jordan.
</p>

<p>
Some years ago I had crossed it about thirty miles higher
up, where it flows across a plateau at an elevation of 1800
feet above the sea. I was now standing on its margin, 550
feet below the sea. In the course of this thirty miles, therefore,
it has a fall of 2350 feet. In other words, it was a fair
presumption that there was a waterfall somewhere between
those two points which had never been visited. The inquiries
which I made from the natives on the point were unsatisfactory
in their result. They seemed unable to discriminate
between a rapid and a waterfall, and although they told me
of many places where the water rushed with great violence,
they seemed to know of none where it was precipitous. Upon
one point they were, unfortunately, all agreed, which was
that there was no path up the river-side, and that it would
be found impossible at this time of year, when the stream
was flooded, to force a way up. However, we determined
to try. We thought we should be more free in our movements
if we were unhampered by a guide, and directed only
by our topographical instincts.
</p>

<p>
We therefore left our tents standing, as a sort of home on
which to retreat in case of need, and struck across the small
plain upon which the springs are situated, to a ford, which
four days previously had been impracticable, but which we
<span class="pageno target" title="131" id="page-131"></span>
were assured we might now risk with safety. The stream
was here a hundred yards broad, full of large rocks, and
with a swift, turbid current that was by no means reassuring.
The water came high up on our saddle-flaps, but we
reached the other bank without mishap, and found ourselves
skirting a dense thicket of tropical underwood, above which
a grove of at least three hundred date-trees reared their
tufted crests. It was a spot unlike any other to be found in
Palestine, for, although the heat in the valley of the Jordan,
owing to its depression below the sea, is as great as this, and
at its southern extremity greater, nowhere throughout its
length is to be found a spot where the vegetation is so dense
and luxuriant. Here were wild orange, lemon, fig, almond,
and mulberry trees, oleanders growing to a gigantic size,
besides butm, sidr, carob, and other trees peculiar to the
country, and thickets of cane twenty feet high, forming a
splendid cover for the wild boars with which we were assured
this jungle abounds.
</p>

<p>
The Arabs come here at certain seasons to gather the
dates, weave mats from the reeds, and harvest the crops of
the slopes behind, which were now all waving with young
grain. During that time they live in mud hovels, partly excavated
in the ground, which were now deserted. There
was only one inhabitant, and he ran a small mill, picturesquely
situated under some date-trees, which was turned
by a stream of hot sulphur water issuing from a copious
spring, with a temperature of 112°. The Yarmuk, which
flows beneath a cliff of black basalt three hundred feet high,
half encircles this unique spot, and I regretted that I had
not time to explore it thoroughly; but the jungle was so impenetrable
that it was impossible to make any impression
upon it without an axe, and then it would have been a work
of time.
</p>

<p>
We now followed a track which approached the river
bank. The hills, fortunately, on our side sloped back gradually.
Midway up the sheer face of the cliff opposite
we saw here and there caves, which, from their regular
shape, appear at one time to have been inhabited, but if so,
the only approach could have been from above, by baskets
lowered to the mouths, similar to the method used by the
<span class="pageno target" title="132" id="page-132"></span>
robbers who inhabited the Wady Hamam, behind the plain
of Gennesareth, in days of old. Now, instead of robbers in
baskets, we saw immense eagles sailing in front of the cliff,
in the crevices of which they had placed their nests. Crossing
a spur which jutted into the river from the mountains
on our right, and which prevented our following it closely,
we obtained a splendid view of its course for some miles.
To our left were basalt and limestone cliffs, and above them
steep, sloping grass lands, now carpeted with wild flowers.
Above them again were more crags and cliffs, and then the
rim which marked the edge of the plateau, fifteen hundred
feet above us. To the right the hills sloped back
more slowly, cleft here and there by wild, rocky valleys,
while their summits were fringed with oak forests. Here
and there the river foamed between precipices on both sides,
and we began to perceive that the task of exploration was
by no means easy. But it was perhaps all the more interesting.
We made our horses scramble where only goats had
been before, now along the base of the cliff over huge boulders,
now half-way up its precipitous side, when prudence
suggested that horse and rider should separate, and each be
responsible for his own life and limbs. Now we forced our
way through tangled thickets of flowering shrubs that clung
to the rocky sides where they were less steep, and now, utterly
baffled, diverging from the river and toiling up a steep
grassy slope, only to slip and scramble down it again on the
other side so as to regain the margin of the stream.
</p>

<p>
Our progress was necessarily slow, not only owing to the
natural obstacles we encountered, but to the fact that we
were mapping the country as we advanced; but the scenery
by which we were surrounded was too romantic to be hurried
over, and too interesting, from its novelty, not to be
carefully noted. At last we reached a point where there
had been a land-slide, leaving bare one precipice a thousand
feet high, while it formed another above the stream, which
it had displaced. Nothing remained for it but to attempt
another ford, and try our luck on the opposite bank. This,
to the amazement of some Bedouins, who watched us from
it and waved us back, we succeeded in accomplishing, not
without a narrow escape on the part of one of our party who,
<span class="pageno target" title="133" id="page-133"></span>
boldly leading the way, got entangled among the rocks and
eddies. We were cordially welcomed by an Arab sheik, as we
scrambled like half-drowned rats up the bank. He invited us
to his tents, which were pitched a few hundred yards back
from the stream, on a small plain. Here mats were spread for
us, coffee roasted, pounded, and prepared, and, the young men
gathering around, we proceeded, under the influence of an
abundant distribution of cigarettes on my part, to exchange
ideas. They told us they belonged to a village two and a
half hours distant, and were therefore not nomads. They
came hither at this season of the year to pasture their herds
and look after their crops. I hardly like to report the conversation
of these poor people as they came to confide their
grievances to us, without our in any way inviting their confidence.
Suffice it to say that the recent measure of the
government by which it has been decided to substitute for
the dime, which has heretofore been the share of the government
in the entire produce of every village, an assessment
based on the highest five years' average, has produced
the greatest discontent among the rural population, whose
poverty and distress, already extreme, owing to the extortion
of the tax-gatherers even under the old system, and the
withdrawal of the bone and sinew of the country by conscription,
especially during the recent Russo-Turkish war,
will thus be intensified. In fact, these poor people were
driven to such desperation that they were most unreserved
in their language, and although they are the most long-suffering
and much-enduring of races, there is a point where
the crushed worm will turn. However great the financial
exigencies of the empire may be, they would better be
met by a thorough reorganization and reform in the whole
system of tax-collecting, than in adding to the burdens of
the people, which are already greater than they can bear.
</p>

<p>
Our hosts assured us that we should find any further attempt
to ascend the river impracticable, and that there was
a place where the water fell for a considerable height, but
we could only reach it by making a circuit, which would take
a day. However, we determined to judge for ourselves, and
succeeded in getting about a mile farther, when we found the
river shut in by precipices on both sides. It was impossible
<span class="pageno target" title="134" id="page-134"></span>
to descend to it from the brow of the cliff on which we stood,
much less to ford it afterwards, or to scramble up the precipice
on the other side. There was nothing for it but to make
an ascent of at least fifteen hundred feet, either to the high
plateau of Jaulan, on the right, or to recross the river where
we had already forded it, and scramble up the steep, wooded
hillsides of Ajlun until we could find a path leading in
the desired direction. This latter course we determined to
adopt; so we returned to the Arabs tents, crossed the river
more successfully than before, warned by our previous experience,
and braced ourselves for a twelve-hundred-feet
climb up the best track we could find, under the guidance of
one of our recent Arab acquaintances. I had been on the
lookout all through the day for ruins, and I was now cheered
by the intelligence that I should find some on the summit
of the hill we were climbing. Such proved to be the case.
The situation, at an elevation by my aneroid of about eleven
hundred feet above the sea, would indicate that in old time
it was a fortress. It was supplied with water by cisterns,
the remains of which still exist, some of them demijohn-shaped,
and one about ten feet square and twenty feet to
the bottom, which, however, was much filled up. There
were many piles of huge blocks of drafted stone, but I did
not observe any columns or carving, and I think the remains
date from a period anterior to the Roman occupation.
The modern name of the place is Tel el-Hösn, but its existence
has heretofore been unknown, except to the Arabs of
the neighborhood, and its discovery was some compensation
to me for the effort I had made to reach it.

<a href="#toc-27">EXPLORATION ON THE YARMUK.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, May 15.—From the ancient fortress of El-Hösn
we crossed a spur to a high projecting point, from which
we could look down a sheer precipice one thousand feet
high, which had been formed by a land-slip, to the bed of
the river. Forcing their way impetuously through a gorge
opposite, the tributary waters of the Rukkad mingled their
clear stream with the turbid Yarmuk, after a rapid course
from their source in the highlands of Jaulan, from which elevated
plateau they are precipitated in a magnificent waterfall
eight hundred feet high. All this scenery is as yet absolutely
unknown and unexplored, this fall having only recently
been discovered, by my travelling companion on this
occasion. I regretted being unable to visit it, but we were
limited for time, and although it was only hidden from
view by a projecting spur of the valley, so broken up is this
country by precipitous ravines and gorges, that it would
have taken us a day's hard riding to reach it.
</p>

<p>
It was with regret that we found ourselves compelled
to leave the elevated position on which we now stood, and
which commanded an extensive view, limited in the extreme
east by the lofty mountains of the Jebel Druze; and, steering
our way by compass, struck a southeasterly direction, over
a park-like, undulating country, covered with oak forest,
with occasional patches of cultivation. This part of the
country to the east of the Jordan, which is called the Keferat,
is thinly inhabited, the villages being very small,
squalid, and far apart, but it is a country all waiting to
yield of its abundance to some future race who may turn
its magnificent resources to good account. In many places
the trees were festooned with vines, the grapes of this district
being celebrated, but the population pay little heed to
their cultivation, for it is impossible to protect them from
<span class="pageno target" title="136" id="page-136"></span>
robbers. The Bedouins consider the sedentary inhabitants
as lawful spoil, and raid over these lands at will, practically
almost unchecked by the authorities, whose administrative
hold on the country is of the slenderest description. It is,
in fact, chiefly exercised at those times when it is necessary
to send the mounted police into the villages to collect the
taxes, and they clear up all that the Bedouins may have
left, so that these poor people are engaged in a perpetual
struggle to keep body and soul together, and although they
are surrounded by a fertile country which, if it were properly
cultivated, would make them wealthy, they only cultivate
enough for their barest necessities, and have not the
heart to attempt to accumulate wealth which they would
not be permitted to keep. Situated at an elevation of about
eighteen hundred feet above the sea, these high, wooded,
fertile table-lands form a district which, should this country
ever come to be occupied under more favourable conditions
than now exist, will certainly be among the first to
attract an agricultural population. The wild, rocky gorges
by which it is intersected render the task of exploration,
without a guide, one attended with some uncertainty. We
take our bearings by compass, gallop under the vine-trellised
trees, over green, level slopes, or along inviting glades,
till we are suddenly brought up by a precipice down which
it is impossible to scramble, which opens unexpectedly in a
gulf at our feet. The spot we are making for is not half a
mile distant, but we have to follow the edge of the gorge in
the opposite direction. Then we come upon another at
right angles, which forces us to double back still farther; so
at last we wind round the head, first of one ravine and then
of another, till we find two hours have elapsed since we
were driven back on our tracks; the half-mile has now extended
over five or six, the sun is declining with a rapidity
which seems accelerated because the daylight has become
so precious to us that we cannot bear to anticipate the prospect
of its vanishing. At last we reach the head of the
valley which has baffled us so long, and are compensated by
discovering a ruin. Here are sarcophagi, rock tombs and
cisterns, and carved fragments. Fortunately we come across
a peasant, the only one we have seen since leaving the
<span class="pageno target" title="137" id="page-137"></span>
river, and he tells us that its name is Haleebna. We write
it down and take its bearings as well as we can, for it is unknown
heretofore, but the day is too far spent for us to linger
for minute examination. The peasant tells us that the
best thing we can do, if we would get back to our tents, is
to go down the valley we had intended to cross. We follow
his advice and have no reason to regret it. It is a <i>Viâ
Mala</i> of grandeur and beauty, though on a small scale. We
pass between curved limestone cliffs, the fissures in which
are filled with underwood, the shrubs cling to the rocks,
from which at one place gushes a copious stream of water,
by the side of which we hurry with it down the valley, till
we get back to the Yarmuk once more, and, wearied and exhausted,
reach our tents in the gathering darkness. Here
we find a picturesque-looking Kurd waiting to receive us;
he is an old soldier, and shows us the scars of five wounds—not
all, however, received in military service, but for the
most part in Arab skirmishes. He is the agent of the government
in these parts, and also of the native capitalist who
is the practical owner of the land, which is cultivated by an
Arab tribe whose tents are pitched near us; they are heavily
indebted to the capitalist aforesaid, who allows them
enough of the crops to keep them from starving and takes
all the rest himself. And our Kurdish visitor is his collector
of revenue. He seems to have some difficulty in protecting
his employer's interests, and tells us triumphantly
that only a few nights before he has shot an Arab whom he
caught plundering. He says that during the bathing season
as many as a hundred tents may be seen pitched round the
sulphur springs of Amatha, and that their fame is so great
that they are visited by invalids from Aleppo and Damascus.
The fact, however, that Tiberias, which is five hours distant,
is the nearest place in which supplies of any sort can
be procured, and that the only accommodation to be obtained
is the patient's own tent, must operate as a serious
obstacle to the use of these springs, about whose curative
value, however, there can be no doubt.
</p>

<p>
Our way from Amatha lay back across the Jordan valley,
which at this season of the year is a sheet of waving grain,
cultivated by a branch of the Beni Sukkr Arabs, whose
<span class="pageno target" title="138" id="page-138"></span>
large encampment, with the handsome tent of the sheik in
the centre, we pass without stopping, for we are in full pursuit
at the moment of five gazelles, which scamper across
country, giving us a good run, in which we should have certainly
overtaken them had we not been checked by a ravine.
We cross the Yarmuk at a point near its junction with the
Jordan, and where it carries a volume of water certainly
equal to that stream. The Jordan here falls in a fine rapid
of about thirty feet in a distance of less than a hundred
yards, and would furnish splendid water-power for mills in
a part of the country which is much in want of them. The
ancient Jisr el-Medjamieh spans the stream at this point,
guarded by a government toll-house. Crossing it, we determined
to try a short-cut up the little-known Wady Bireh,
which is watered by a clear, purling brook, which, if it were
utilized, would make this valley one of the most fertile and
attractive in this part of the country. After following its
winding course for some miles, we found it finally narrowing
into a crooked gorge, the sides of which approach so
closely as scarcely to admit the passage of a loaded camel
between the overhanging rocks. Indeed, when we afterwards
described our route to the natives they said it was
never used by them. However, it gave us an opportunity
of seeing some most romantic scenery, and by shortening
the way enabled us to reach Nazareth, jaded and worn out,
it is true, the same night.

<a href="#toc-28">A DRUSE RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, May 27.—Travellers who have gone from Nazareth
to Tiberias must be familiar with the singular outline
of a mountain which they perceive to the left of the road,
with its two rocky crests separated from each other by
a hog's back about a quarter of a mile long, and called the
Horns of Hattin. The summit of the higher peak, one thousand
feet above the sea, and about three hundred feet above
the plain across which they are riding, forms a conspicuous
object in a landscape which, at this point, is one of singular
interest and beauty. Rising like a gigantic natural pulpit,
tradition has since declared it to be the Mount of the Beatitudes,
and asserts that it was from this picturesque elevation
that Christ delivered that sermon which has exercised
so vast an influence on mankind ever since.
</p>

<p>
Whether this be so or not, it is certain that the plain on
which the audience was supposed to have gathered which
listened to it, was the scene, about eleven hundred and fifty-seven
years afterwards, of the most memorable conflict in
which the Crusaders ever engaged, for it was the one which
lost them Palestine, and which resulted in the triumph of
Saladin, the Saracen, and the slaughter or capture of the
most powerful and celebrated of the Crusading chiefs. At
the extremity of the plain, and immediately beneath one of
the horns of the mountain, there is a precipitous gorge,
down which some of the hardly pressed Crusaders vainly
attempted flight, the horses and their riders, heavily panoplied
with armour, only escaping the spear of the Arab to
meet an even more terrible fate, as they hurled themselves
headlong down the rocky precipice. As, dismounting from
my active steed, I allowed him to pick his own way down
this dangerous defile, I looked with interest at the scene
of the disaster, and listened to the story of my guide, who
<span class="pageno target" title="140" id="page-140"></span>
narrated how, only twenty years ago, a fight had taken
place here between a celebrated Bedouin chief and a Kurdish
tribe, in which the latter were signally defeated on the
old Crusading battle-ground, and, seeking safety, like the
Christian warriors, in the direction of this treacherous gorge,
left sixty dead men and horses at the bottom.
</p>

<p>
These traditions and associations served to enhance the
novelty  and picturesqueness of the view before me as I entered
the gorge, for it was now the scene of a great gathering
of the sheiks and chiefs of the Druse nation, who come
here annually on a pilgrimage to the shrine of one of their
most celebrated saints, at which I was fortunate enough to
be allowed to assist, a privilege which, so far as I am aware,
had not before been granted to a foreigner. The building
which forms this sacred resort has been erected by the
Druses over the tomb of a certain holy man called Schaib,
but exactly who Schaib was my utmost endeavours failed to
discover. The Moslems say that he is Jethro, the father-in-law
of Moses; but when I asked the Druses whether Moses
had married Schaib's daughter, they denied it. Then a Jew
of the country, familiar with the Druses, suggested that
Schaib was Balaam, but they refused altogether to admit
that an ass had ever spoken to their holy man. He had
crossed the Red Sea with Moses, they said, and after Moses'
death had been ordered by God to bury him, and had done
so, and had fought against a mighty king and prevailed
against him, and had himself been buried here, and he was
the Father of all Prophets and the elect of God, and there
were none greater or more sacred than he. I thought possibly
he might be Joshua, but him they knew by his own
name, so I have given up the personality of Schaib as an insoluble
mystery. He is one of those Druse characters whom
their tradition has interwoven with Biblical history, but the
tomb which they thus honour is undoubtedly considered by
Moslems to be the tomb of Jethro, who is known among
them as Schaib; and the Rabbi Bar Simeon, writing in
1210 <span class="sc small">A.D.</span>, mentions the tomb of Jethro as being at Hattin.
Considering that Jethro lived in Midian, on the shores of
the Red Sea, it seems rather unlikely that he should be buried
here. However, that is a detail. The fact remains that
<span class="pageno target" title="141" id="page-141"></span>
the spot is one of great sanctity, but is infinitely more venerated
by the Druses than by the Moslems. Indeed, I met
a Moslem who laughed at the Druses' superstitions in regard
to it, and who was as much surprised and puzzled as I
was when he heard them deny that Moses was the son-in-law
of the buried saint.
</p>

<p>
The building which the Druses have erected over the old,
dilapidated Moslem shrine, which still stands here, has already
cost more than $5000, all subscribed by the Druses
among themselves, and it is not yet completed. It consists
of a courtyard, one side of which is formed by the solid
rock, while the other contains chambers. The roof forms a
terrace, and above it, also partly faced by rock, is a large
upper chamber surmounted by a dome. The scene as we
approached was very striking. The Druse sheiks, desirous
of doing honour to their guest, formed in two lines to receive
me, while guns were fired off and songs of welcome
were sung. The white building, with its terraces crowded
by men and women in bright-coloured garments, harmonized
well with the romantic character of the scenery, and
formed a picture calculated to impress the imagination.
</p>

<p>
I was ushered by my hosts into an anteroom, after exchanging
cordial greetings with those I knew, and being introduced
to those who were still strangers to me; and then
we all squatted on carpets, thus occupying all the four sides
of the room, which assumed the appearance of a sort of
council-chamber. As, with the exception of the Japanese,
the Druses are the politest and most courteous people I
have ever met, a great part of our time is taken up in salutations
and compliments. First we press our hands to our
hearts and lips and foreheads, with great effusion. No sooner
are we seated than we repeat this process as if we had
not done it just before. Then, in flowery language, we ask
each other repeatedly after our respective healths, and are
profuse in our thanks to God that we are well, that they
are well, that our families are well, and that we are permitted
to enjoy the great privilege of meeting one another.
Then coffee is brought in, and after drinking it we go
through the same process of saluting each other all around.
Then I request permission to light a cigarette, which is
<span class="pageno target" title="142" id="page-142"></span>
necessary, as the Druses never indulge in tobacco; indeed,
the more rigid eschew coffee.
</p>

<p>
As I look around at the twenty or thirty sheiks, solemnly
seated with their backs to the wall, I am much struck with
the dignity of their bearing, the intelligence of their countenances,
and their superior physique generally. As a rule,
there is a religious and a secular sheik to each village, so
that about half my entertainers exercise spiritual functions,
and half temporal. There was nothing, however, in their
dress to distinguish them. They all wore white turbans,
black or striped <i>abbas</i>, or wide-sleeved cloaks reaching to
the knee, beneath which was the usual flowing garment of
the Oriental, and their feet were bare. Many of the Druses,
both men and women, have brown hair and blue eyes, and
complexions as light as our own, and some of both sexes are
singularly handsome.
</p>

<p>
As all the sheiks had not yet assembled, we had not been
long in conclave—indeed, had hardly exhausted our stock of
compliments—before the singing of men and the firing of
guns announced a distinguished arrival. Then we all went
out to meet him, and I was interested in watching the method
of greeting. I soon perceived that the forms of etiquette
are most rigidly adhered to among them. When two of
equal rank meet they clasp hands, and there appears a slight
struggle—as they both bow their heads and lift their
clasped hands towards their lips—as to who shall kiss the
back of the other's hand first. This involves rather a curious
twisting movement of the hands and heads, which produces
a somewhat comical effect. Let any of my readers
make the experiment, and, grasping each other's hands, try
and kiss the respective backs of each without unclasping
them, and the effort as to which shall succeed first makes
quite a little game. My servant, who is a Moslem from
Egypt, declared that they each kissed their own hands, and
the argument waxed so hot between us that we had to refer
the matter to a Druse to know which was right, so difficult
was it to perceive exactly what really happened. If one
felt himself inferior in rank to the other, he always succeeded
in kissing the other's hand first, and snatching his own
away before the other had time to kiss it. But if the difference
<span class="pageno target" title="143" id="page-143"></span>
in rank was still more marked, the superior made
no pretence of wanting to kiss the inferior's hand after his
own had been kissed.
</p>

<p>
Next came a great struggle as to who should take the
lowest place. The place of honour was a particular corner,
which, had I been better versed in their etiquette, I should
have insisted on declining; but I innocently accepted it, and
then the invariable struggle came as to who should be forced
to sit next to me. I observed that in most instances the refusals
were of that formal kind which young ladies indulge
in when they have made up their minds to sing, but decline
to do so until after they have been sufficiently pressed. I
suppose there were envyings, jealousies, pride, and other
base passions among my hosts as among other men, but if
so they certainly concealed their failings with marvellous
skill. One could not but be struck with the air of genuine
harmony and affectionate cordiality which seemed to prevail
among them.
</p>

<p>
The respect they showed to the head sheik of all, and the
warm terms in which they spoke of him to me in private,
could not but have been sincere, and, indeed, he seemed to
deserve it. Though only a young man of about thirty-five,
he inherited his honours, coming as he did of one of the
most honourable Druse families; yet his distinguishing
characteristic was a marked humility and consideration for
others. His wife was certainly the most charming and lady-like
person I have yet seen among Druse women. She was
not more than three or four and twenty, with a fair complexion,
magnificent eyes, and an elegant figure, a grace
natural to her characterizing all her movements. Indeed,
had she been dressed in the latest Parisian fashion, she
would have been a strikingly attractive person in any society,
nor would it have been possible by her features or complexion
to distinguish her from any pretty American woman.
As it was, her dress was exceedingly becoming. On her
head was a long white veil; a loose, tunic-shaped jacket,
with full sleeves, covered an embroidered sort of chemisette,
and her short, flowing skirts partially concealed full trousers,
tight around the ankle. On her wrists were a pair of heavy
gold bracelets, and she was the only woman of the party
<span class="pageno target" title="144" id="page-144"></span>
who indulged in the luxury of shoes and stockings. The
shoes, however, were always slipped off before entering a
room.
</p>

<p>
The Druse women of Galilee do not, like those of the
Lebanon, cover their faces; and, indeed, they are allowed
a freedom which contrasts strongly with the position of
their Moslem sisters. This wife of the head sheik enjoyed
a privilege denied to any of the other women who had accompanied
their lords to the shrine, for she frequently sat
in the men's council, taking part in the conversation, though
modestly, and with great reserve. In talking to me, which
she did freely, I found that she was bright and intelligent,
and full of inquiries as to the manners and customs of the
females of civilization, in regard to whom she had an intense
curiosity. I do not know, however, whether, if it had been
fully gratified, it would have tended very much to her moral
and intellectual improvement. She had brought her baby
with her, and was generally surrounded by some of the
more prominent of the other ladies, who, however, treated
her with a marked deference. I watched her mode of greeting
the different ladies as they arrived, with even more interest
than I had that of the men. We read in the Bible of
people falling upon each other's necks; this was exactly
what the Druse women did, and very prettily and gracefully
they did it, while they recognized the men by a distant,
modest, and deferential salutation.

<a href="#toc-29">THE GREAT FESTIVAL OF THE DRUSES.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, May 30.—Towards evening of the day on which
I arrived at the great Druse shrine of Neby Schaib, near
Hattin, most of the sheiks who were expected had arrived,
with their retinues. It might have been a feudal gathering
of olden time; the noisy welcome of the chiefs, the clansmen
singing war-songs and firing guns, the women following
on donkeys, all combined to make a scene which carried
one back to the Middle Ages, and I never wearied looking
at it.
</p>

<p>
My tent was pitched on the lowest terrace of the sacred
building, for it is not allowed to the unbeliever to pass the
night within those holy precincts. Indeed, it was an unprecedented
privilege to be permitted even to camp on the
terrace, where there was only just room for my tent, nor
should I have been allowed to edge in so close to the mysteries
of Druse worship had there been five square yards
of level ground within a quarter of a mile. But the precipitous
rocks frowned above us all around, and the comparatively
open space below was crowded with camels,
horses, and donkeys, compelled to chum together, whether
they liked it or not, and where the incessant din added to
the general uproar of the place. The constant and stentorian
braying of donkeys, varied occasionally by a horse
fight, mingled with the barking of dogs, the shrill scream
of welcome or ululation of women, the loud singing and
clapping of hands of the dancing circles, and the firing of
guns, all augured badly for a night's rest.
</p>

<p>
However, there was no thought of going to bed yet; great
piles of rice on which whole sheep had been skilfully dissected
were now borne in on round platters, each carried by
two men. There must have been from three to four hundred
people now collected at the shrine, and the feeding of
<span class="pageno target" title="146" id="page-146"></span>
such a multitude was no joke. Of these nearly half were
women, all in gala dress, the favourite colours being blue,
green, and red. I don't know that I ever remember in the
same number to have seen a larger proportion of pretty
women.
</p>

<p>
When I went up-stairs to the large vault which contains
the tomb of the prophet I came upon them unexpectedly,
all seated on the floor around the circular mats of parti-coloured
straw which they use as tablecloths. The room,
which was seventy feet long by forty wide, was crowded
with this laughing, chattering, feeding, feminine multitude,
with their glorious eyes, white, regular teeth, bewitching
smiles, and delicate fingers plunged up to the knuckles into
huge piles of greasy rice. Their invitation that I should
come and take pot-luck with them produced a mixed sentiment
in my breast. However, it was only said as a joke,
for even had I desired I should not have been allowed to
accept it. The entertainment was exclusively feminine, and
I was surprised at so little reverence being shown to the
venerated shrine by the close proximity of all this festivity.
</p>

<p>
Taking off our shoes and picking our way between these
festive groups, we reached, at the other end of the hall, the
tomb of the prophet, enclosed in a wooden screen hung
with red cloth, while over the tomb itself was spread a sort
of green silk pall, embroidered with gold stars. Some of
the Druse sheiks who accompanied me reverently pressed
their lips to this. They then pointed out a square block of
limestone, in the centre of which was a piece of alabaster
containing the imprint of a human foot of natural size.
The toes are defined with more clearness than is usual in
sacred footprints of this nature, and the Druses stooped and
kissed the impression, assuring me that, if I would do so, I
should feel that the rock exuded moisture, and that its peculiarity
was that it was never dry. I was constrained out
of politeness to appear to accede to their wishes, though I
refrained from testing the condition of the stone with my
lips, as I felt suspicious, considering how many lips had preceded
mine, that any little dampness I might discover might
be easily accounted for otherwise than supernaturally.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="147" id="page-147"></span>
</div>

<p>
The question of footprints in the rock suggests some interesting
considerations. There are one or two others in
different parts of Palestine, as in the mosque at Hebron,
built over the Cave of Macpelah, and as they are artificial,
it is probable that they are coronation stones. We know
by tradition that in ancient times a custom of this sort existed
in the British Isles, where footprints in rock exist, and
there are Scriptural allusions which give colour to a similar
hypothesis in Palestine. The pillar alluded to in the crowning
of kings was probably nothing more nor less than a
coronation stone; and the habit which existed in some
countries of making the king stand with his foot in the impression
of a print in the stone, as a sign that he would
walk in the footsteps of his predecessor, may account for
their occurrence in Palestine. Thus we read that Abimelech
“was made king by the oak of the pillar that was in
Shechem;” when Joash was anointed king by Jehoida,
“he stood by the pillar as the manner was,” and the same
king “stood by a pillar to make a covenant, and all the people
stood to the covenant.” The place of the footprint at
Neby Schaib, in its elevated position above the copious fountain
which gushes from the base of the opposite cliff, and
the remarkable cropping up of the alabaster through the
rock, rendered it just such a spot as would be likely to be
chosen for such a purpose, and I think we may fairly hazard
the conjecture that the footprint at the Neby Schaib marks
the coronation stone of the rulers in this part of the country
in early Jewish, or perhaps even more ancient, times.
It is far otherwise with the footprint of Buddha on Adam's
Peak in Ceylon, and with that of Christ on the Mount of
Olives, both of which I have seen, and both of which are
natural, and bear only a fancied resemblance to the human
foot, that of Buddha being a depression in the rock about
five feet long. In the case of the print under consideration,
there was a split in the rock across the centre, which the
Druses accounted for by saying that when the prophet
stepped here he split the rock.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the women, having finished their repast, now
prepared for a dance on the terrace. The music consisted
of singing, with a hand-clapping accompaniment, executed
<span class="pageno target" title="148" id="page-148"></span>
principally by the spectators, while the dancers formed in
a circle, holding each other by the waistband, and rhythmically
swaying to and fro, as from time to time they
changed the character and the measure of their step. All
their movements were decorous, if not all actually graceful.
Sometimes one would separate herself from the ring, and,
advancing to the centre, perform a <i>pas seul</i>, while the others
danced around her, she the while flinging her hands aloft,
waving in each a light muslin veil, and making it float above
her head, while she kept time with her feet. But among
the Druses, as among most Orientals, the hands play as
prominent a part in their terpsichorean exercises as their
feet. The eminently good looks of the dancers were set off
by their becoming costumes. These consisted of outer
cloaks of a rich colour, linen or woollen, open all down the
front so as to display the whole underdress, with light sleeves
cut above the elbow, the whole trimmed either with wide
bands of reddish satin or with a rich cross-stitch embroidery
of silk. The unsightliness of the baggy trousers of dark
blue is lost under the long, semi-transparent chemise, which
falls over them as a white tunic, generally striped with
thicker white, and tastefully embroidered with silk around
the neck. The white sleeves of the chemise, widely pointed,
and which flow about the forearm after escaping from
the short cloak sleeve, form a simple but very graceful
feature of this costume, whether they float freely or are
twisted, for convenience in work, about the elbow. Scarfs
of various bright colours are wound below the waist, and
the cloak is usually caught together below the bosom by
a cord or button, giving that double girdle often presented
in ancient classical costume. The simple long, white
cloth, with the centre of one edge drawn low upon the
forehead, its two ends hanging down the back almost to
the heels, bound fast by a wide fillet of brilliant colour
tied around the head, completes very attractively, with its
ancient Egyptian appearance, this simple but highly characteristic
dress, which is enhanced by necklaces and bangles,
according to the rank and position of the wearer.
</p>

<p>
Our attention was now distracted by some rival performances
of the male part of the community in the courtyard
<span class="pageno target" title="149" id="page-149"></span>
below. Here the singing and clapping of hands were louder
and more vehement, and time was given by one gentleman
who played a pipe and another who was a sort of bandmaster,
and directed the changes of time and step. Here
the central figure who danced in the circle, instead of waving
veils or handkerchiefs, flourished a sword with great
grace and dexterity, slashing it about in excellent time to
the music, and within an inch sometimes of the noses, sometimes
of the legs, of the performers. The dancers worked
themselves up at last to a high pitch of excitement and perspiration,
new ones perpetually dashing into the ring and
taking the places of those who were exhausted.
</p>

<p>
At last the gayeties were put an end to by the sheiks,
who took no part in them themselves, but looked on with
solemn dignity. The “okâl,” or initiated in the holy mysteries,
despise all such frivolities, which are reserved for
women and the uninitiated. Most of these had been sitting
in a circle in a quiet part of the terrace by themselves, discussing
either religion or the political questions affecting
the interests of their nation, most probably the latter; but
the hour had now arrived when the serious business of the
night was to begin and festivity was to cease. The uproar
died away, the elders wished us good-night, and silently
trooped up the stone stairs to the great hall, whence issued
the younger part of the female community, and I retired to
the door of my tent to sit in the bright moonlight and contemplate
the strange surroundings of my night quarters.
</p>

<p>
Soon there broke upon the stillness of the night the measured
cadence of a sacred chant. Now it swelled, as numerous
voices, male and female, took up the chorus; now it
died away to a single voice. Never before, probably, had
stranger been able to listen so closely to the prayers and invocations
which characterize the mysterious and occult
worship of the Druses. One thing surprised me, which I
think is not generally known, and this is that women undoubtedly
take part in some of their forms of worship, not,
however, in all, for on the following night they were excluded,
and the service was conducted by males alone. At
last I went to bed, but not to sleep; the noises of the animals,
to which I was in close proximity, for a long time banished
<span class="pageno target" title="150" id="page-150"></span>
repose, and when at last it came fitfully, I heard ever
and anon the rhythm of the sacred chant. Throughout two
entire nights, to my certain knowledge, did these Druses
pray and sing, though, as I fell asleep on each occasion
towards morning, I cannot precisely say at what hour their
service was concluded.
</p>

<p>
There can be no doubt that, while these gatherings are
essentially religious in their character, they are largely used
for political purposes. In this respect a wonderful organization
exists among the Druses. Although the nation may
be said to be divided into three sections, of which one—by
far the largest—occupies the mountains of the Hauran,
known as the Jebel Druse, another the mountains of the
Lebanon, and the third and smallest the hills of northern
Galilee, they keep up a close contact with each other, and
meetings such as these afford opportunities for them to hold
counsel in regard to the political fortunes and condition of
the nation. The Druses of the Jebel Druse, who form two
thirds of the nation, have only this year made peace with
the Turkish government, with whom they were at war last
year, The impracticable nature of the country, combined
with their own bravery, enables them to maintain a sort of
quasi independence. They are free from the conscription,
have a governor, or Caimakam, chosen from among themselves,
and their taxes are little more than nominal. The
Druses of the Lebanon come under the special statute relating
to the government of that province, and as this is
subject to the supervision of the six European treaty powers,
their position is secured, and they have no cause of
grievance, though they are in close contact with their neighbours,
the Maronites, with whom they live on terms of considerable
tension. The Druses of Galilee differ in position
from the other two sections of the nation, in that they enjoy
no privileges of any kind, but are, on the contrary, less
fortunately placed in their relations to the government than
either Moslems or Christians, the former being naturally, to
a certain extent, favored by their government, and the latter
being always able, in case of a grievance, to appeal to
some Christian European power. These Druses are, however,
absolutely without protection of any kind, and have
<span class="pageno target" title="151" id="page-151"></span>
many grievances unredressed, and many acts of hostility on
the part of the peasantry of other religions, among whom
they live, to struggle against. The only consolation they
enjoy is the support and comfort they derive from the close
tribal family connection which they keep up with the other
two more fortunate branches of the nation. It is easy to
perceive, therefore, why they should attach great value to
these religious gatherings, and utilize them for secular purposes.
There can be no doubt that the character of their religion,
with the secrecy which surrounds it, enables them to
organize in a special manner, and that the theocratic element
which enters into their political constitution gives them a
cohesion, a unity, and a power for combined action which
the Christian sects, with their jealousies, bigotry, and internal
dissensions, do not enjoy.

<a href="#toc-30">HATTIN AND IRBID.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, June 22.—While my two days' experiences at the
Neby Schaib, described in my last two letters, were in the
highest degree novel and picturesque, and enabled me to
obtain an unusual insight into the manners and customs and
religious observances of the Druse nation, my stay at this
celebrated shrine of their pilgrimage was by no means destitute
of archæological interest. The village of Hattin,
which is in the immediate neighbourhood of the tomb of
the prophet, forms the centre of many sacred and historical
associations, while it is in itself a place of unusual beauty
of situation.
</p>

<p>
In the overhanging rocks on the other side of the gorge,
immediately opposite my tent, were several sepulchral
chambers, all traditional burying-places of persons more or
less historical. Some of these I examined. The largest
was one entered by a doorway, which had recently been inhabited,
for the framework of a wooden door to it still remained.
It was supposed to be the burial-place of one of
Jethro's daughters. We are told by Josephus that his family
followed the Israelites out of Midian. Its last occupant
was an Indian hermit, who had lived here in solitude for
three years, when, getting tired of his seclusion, he had
gone to Tiberias about a year ago, married there, and immediately
disappeared with his wife, no one knew whither.
</p>

<p>
About a hundred yards from the Neby there issues from
the mouth of the gorge a copious spring which, in fact,
forms the source of a brook, that ultimately finds its way
into the Sea of Galilee. It commences its beneficent course,
however, by fertilizing a large area immediately surrounding
the village, where flourishing gardens of oranges, lemons,
figs, apricots, pomegranates, and other fruit-trees impart
an air of luxuriant fertility to the landscape not common in
<span class="pageno target" title="153" id="page-153"></span>
these parts. Among these gardens is one which was purchased
a few years ago by Sir Moses Montefiore, and presented
by him to the Jews of Tiberias. Here I went, at the
invitation of the overseer, and, seated on mats under the
spreading arms of a fig-tree, I listened, while I sipped his
coffee, to his tale of woe: how last year he had resisted what
he considered an exorbitant charge for taxes, how his garden
had in consequence been invaded and despoiled by the
tax-gatherers; how, being a British-protected subject, and
the garden being the property of British subjects, he had
appealed to the British consul for redress; how he had
spent £50 in the effort to obtain it, and had found British
protection not only a broken, but an expensive reed to trust
to; and how he was driven, by the refusal of the British
government to protect its subjects, to try and protect himself
by the plentiful expenditure of backsheesh. I explained
to him that it was not the habit of the British government
to protect its subjects, but rather to abandon them, even
though they might be of exalted rank, and their lives might
be at stake; and then I went in search of ruins.
</p>

<p>
I found some immediately adjoining the garden. What
had evidently once formed part of an old Byzantine church
was here turned into a mosque; and upon one of the stones
was a curious Cufic inscription. In some of the other gardens
were traces of foundations, indicating that in old times
Hattin must have been the site of a considerable town. It
is about two miles from the ruins of Irbid (which is no
doubt the Arbela of Josephus), and is probably the Caphar
Hittia of the Talmud, but I find no mention of the Hattin
ruins in the memoirs of the Palestine Exploration Fund,
nor of the Cufic inscription which I found. The way to Irbid
lies across the plain, on which a collection of seven
basalt stones in a ring are called the “Hajaret en Nusara,”
or “stones of the Christians,” because tradition has it that
it was here that Christ performed the miracle of the seven
loaves and two fishes.
</p>

<p>
The plain was now waving with grain, nor would it be
possible to imagine a more fertile or luxuriant upland. On
its margin, where it breaks off abruptly into the marvellous
gorge of El-Hamam, with its precipitous sides rising twelve
<span class="pageno target" title="154" id="page-154"></span>
hundred feet sheer up from the little stream which trickles
at their base, are the ruins of Irbid, interesting as containing
the remains of the oldest Jewish synagogue probably to
be found in Palestine.
</p>

<p>
The steep hillside which slopes down to the edge of the
cliff is very rocky, and numerous sarcophagi are carved on
the surfaces of the natural slabs. The largest measure from
six feet to six feet five inches long, and one foot ten inches
deep, being round at the head and square at the foot, which
is slightly deeper. There was a ledge cut round to receive
the stone cover, and a channel made to keep the surface
water from running in. They were of all sizes, some, evidently,
for small children and babies. But the most remarkable
tomb was one which opened out of a deep, rock-cut
chamber, which appeared to have been in connection with
a wine-press. The antechamber formed a sunk court, about
twenty feet by ten, and contained a sarcophagus. It opened
into a tomb containing six loculi. My guide was the Jew
who had entertained me in the garden, and who was well
versed in local traditions.
</p>

<p>
He informed me that here were supposed to be buried
four of the sons of Jacob, he did not know which, and Jochabed
and Dinah. He also pointed out to me the tomb of
the Rabbi Nitai, who was supposed to have built the synagogue
I had been examining, and who was a native of the
place, and lived about two hundred years <span class="sc small">B.C.</span>; also a mound
of stones covering apparently a rock tomb, which he declared
was the burial-place of Seth, the son of Adam; but,
although from much habit I am accustomed to swallow a
fair amount of traditional information, I was unable to push
my credulity thus far. It is described, however, by the
Rabbi Gerson, <span class="sc small">A.D.</span> 1561, as being in a cave with a spring
to which a flight of steps led down. The tombs of Zerah
and Zephaniah were also pointed out. Indeed, there are
few places in Palestine where in the same limited area such
a number of distinguished personages of sacred history are
buried as in the neighbourhood of Arbela, or Irbid. I do
not now include the tombs of the numerous rabbis whom
the Jews hold sacred. If it has a character for sanctity, it
must at one time have had a reputation for strength. From
<span class="pageno target" title="155" id="page-155"></span>
its position it must always have been a military stronghold.
Josephus tells us, in his “Life,” that when he was Governor
of Galilee he fortified it, and laid up stores of grain here;
and it is without doubt the Casale Ardelle of the Teutonic
knights (1250 <span class="sc small">A.D.</span>), the <i>d</i> being an error for <i>b</i>, as it is mentioned
in connection with Tiberias and Beisan, both places
not very distant.
</p>

<p>
The only Biblical reference to this place is that made by
Hosea, when he says, “Therefore shall a tumult arise among
thy people; all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shahnan
spoiled Beth-Arbel in the day of battle.” As we stand here
we can almost look into the caverns with which the face of
the opposite cliff is perforated, while the one on the edge of
which we stand is literally honeycombed with these subterranean
abodes. They are of immense extent, and are
placed over each other in different stories; some are walled
up, leaving doors and windows. Some idea of the extent
of this singular natural fastness may be formed from the
fact that it is capable of containing six thousand men. The
caves communicate with each other by subterranean galleries.
These are the fortified caverns mentioned by Josephus
in connection with Arbela. Bachides, the general of
Demetrius, the third King of Syria, when he invaded Palestine,
encamped at Arbela and subdued those who had taken
refuge in the caves. This event is narrated in Maccabees,
where the caves are called “stories.” It was here, also,
that Herod the Great had his famous fight with the robbers
who had made their dens in the caves, letting down his soldiers
in baskets, and fighting them in mid-air.
</p>

<p>
I was determined to push my explorations to the summits
of the rocky crests which frowned above, and are called the
Horns of Hattin. Scrambling up the steep, rocky hillsides,
we found ourselves at last obliged to leave our horses and
make our way on foot over the huge blocks of basalt which
are thickly strewn around these singular peaks. On reaching
the top we found that they had been artificially superimposed
one on the top of another, so as to form a rocky
rampart of immense solidity. Both crests had, at some period
of remote antiquity, been thus fortified. Beneath one
of them were the foundations and ruins of an ancient town
<span class="pageno target" title="156" id="page-156"></span>
which the inhabitants call “Medinet el-Inweileb,” or “the
ruins of the long tower.” At the southeast of the hill is
an oblong cavern cut in the rock and eased with cement,
which may formerly have been a cistern; and not far from
it are the foundations of a building which the natives say
was a Christian church before the conquest of the country
by the Mohammedans, who subsequently converted it into
a mosque. Nothing could be more striking than the view
from the summit of the highest horn. Immediately beneath
us, some six or seven hundred feet below, I looked down
into the gloomy gorge, with the white walls of the Neby
Schaib contrasting with the black basalt rocks, its terraces
covered with groups of brightly costumed Druses, their
songs as they danced in circles reaching us on the still air
of evening, and beyond, the modern village of Hattin, surrounded
by orange-groves and fruit-gardens of the most
brilliant green. Stretching away on all other sides were vast
uplands of waving grain, till they either sunk away into
valleys or terminated at the base of hills which rose abruptly
above them. To the northeast the precipitous sides of
the Wady Hamam, honeycombed with caves, formed a vista
through which appeared in the distance a green strip of the
plain of Genesareth; beyond it the waters of the Sea of
Galilee, seventeen hundred feet below us, gleamed in the
setting sun. From its eastern margin rose the steep cliffs
above which is the vast plateau of Jaulan, once the grazing
lands of the flocks and herds of Job, while a line of conical
volcanic peaks, backed by snow-clad Hermon, closed the
prospect.

<a href="#toc-31">THE JEWISH FEAST OF THE BURNING AT
TIBERIAS.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, July 8.—In the early days of May there is annually
celebrated at Tiberias a festival in honour of the Rabbi
Mâir, at the large shrine built above his tomb, within a few
hundred yards from the sulphur baths. Thither, having
terminated my visit to the Druses, I determined to repair to
witness the nocturnal ceremonies.
</p>

<p>
I was escorted to the extremity of the village of Hattin
by a band of young Druses, firing guns and singing complimentary
odes, who thus sought to speed with honour the
parting guest, and soon found myself crossing the plain and
entering upon the steep descent that leads to the shores of
the lake. It was a soft, balmy evening, about sunset, when
I reached Tiberias, and found the whole population in movement.
</p>

<p>
The distance from the town to the tomb of the rabbi is
about a mile and a half along the lake shore, and the road
was crowded with merry groups of Jewish men, women,
and children in gala dress, all flocking to the place of meeting.
The two or three boats of which the lake can boast
were even put into requisition, and were slowly drifting
down, their large sails hardly filled with the gentle breeze,
and packed to overflowing with women and children. Tiberias
contains between three and four thousand Jews, and
certainly more than half that number must have turned out,
to say nothing of those attracted from Jerusalem, Safed,
and other places. As those who inhabit Tiberias are nearly
all Sephardim, or Spanish Jews, the men wear the Oriental
dress, while the women indulge in a costume in which the
Western fashions seem grafted on those of the East. The
visitors, who were for the most part Ashkenazim, or German
Jews, could easily be distinguished, as they always appear
<span class="pageno target" title="158" id="page-158"></span>
in the clothes to which they are accustomed in eastern Europe.
It must be confessed that the flowing robe of Asia
is preferable to the long coat or gabardine of Russia and
Roumania.
</p>

<p>
The men usually walked, but a favourite method of locomotion
among the women was donkeyback, and very comical
they looked, sitting astride very wide pads, with their skirts
well up to their knees, and their necks and wrists and foreheads
bedizened with ornaments, while their wigs were often
a perfect garden of flowers. However pretty some of
the faces of the younger members of the female community
might be—and they could not compare for good looks with
the Druse girls—nothing can compensate for the abominable
practice which prevails among them of shaving their
heads and wearing wigs of black hair, which come low down
upon the forehead, and the falseness of which no attempt is
made to disguise.
</p>

<p>
It occurred to me upon this occasion, as I contrasted their
chevelure with that of the Druses, to speculate on the custom
of Druse hairdressing, which is nothing more nor less
than that square cutting across the forehead of locks drawn
over it which has been so much in vogue in England and
America for the last fifteen years, popularly called “banging,”
and which was supposed at first to be copied from the
well-known picture of Raphael as a child. I have since inquired
of some fashionable young Syrian ladies, and the
younger ones assured me at first that the Druses must have
copied this from the Parisian fashions lately introduced at
Beyrout—an obvious impossibility. On applying to older
ladies, however, they confirm the curious fact that this banging
has always been a custom with the Druse people. The
fine ladies of the present generation have little guessed
whom they were imitating in setting saucers upon their own
heads and those of their little ones, and snipping their hair
around them just above their eyes. Nothing could exceed
in vulgarity the tinsel ornamentation of the Jewish head-dresses,
and, to increase the effect, various pigments were
apparently used by many of the ladies to improve their complexions.
</p>

<p>
As this festival takes place in the height of the bathing
<span class="pageno target" title="159" id="page-159"></span>
season, the shore of the lake at this point presented an appearance
of unwonted animation. There were some thirty
or forty tents pitched round the bath-house, which an enterprising
Syrian has leased this year from the government,
and whitewashed; he even went so far as to offer to build a
carriage-road at his own expense for the mile and a half
which it is distant from the town, so as to accommodate patients
who had no tents of their own; but this was the thin
edge of a wedge of civilization at which the authorities took
alarm, and he was sternly forbidden to spend any of his
own money for the public convenience in the manner proposed.
The result is that the bathers are all obliged to live
in tents or mat huts, which are unbearably hot during the
day, or ride from the town and back again for every bath.
</p>

<p>
Patients from all the neighbouring parts of Syria now
mingled with the Jewish crowd, and streamed up the short
ascent which leads to the tomb, the terrace of which was
already thronged. Passing through an archway, I entered
a courtyard where the usual circular dance was in progress,
the performers being exclusively male. The bedizened females
sat in groups, feasting on good things they had
brought with them, and smoking narghiles. Their small
children were tricked out gaudily, and by the light of numerous
flaring lamps the general effect was quaint and gay
enough.
</p>

<p>
Ascending from this scene of revelry up a massive stone
stair, I entered a chamber where the tomb of the rabbi was
surrounded by a wooden enclosure, inside of which were
sundry rabbis and their neophytes praying, with the swaying
motion of the body peculiar to that act of worship, the
whole brilliantly lighted with lamps. There was in the
centre of this chamber, which was crowded, an immense
chandelier, of which only a few lamps were lighted, and
beyond it I was ushered by a Jew, who volunteered to be
my guide, into another room, stifling hot, in which sat the
chief rabbi himself. Here a man was perpetually shouting
in a stentorian voice something which I failed to understand.
The chief rabbi, however, to whom I was introduced,
explained to me that he was at that moment selling by auction
the privilege of lighting the bonfires which were soon
<span class="pageno target" title="160" id="page-160"></span>
to blaze in honour of the deceased rabbi and Simon Ben
Jochai, who, however, seems to be buried elsewhere. This
privilege was put up at two napoleons each, and the first
finally went for three, a fact which the rabbi announced to
the audience in a sonorous Hebrew chant. Then the other
lighting privilege was bought for a little less, the money,
according to my informant, being given to the poor. After
that a dozen more sales were made, simply for lamplighting,
the amounts bid averaging half a napoleon.
</p>

<p>
Then a sort of procession was formed, and the crowd
surged out down the steps to the courtyard, in the centre of
which were two columns, each surmounted by a sort of
large saucer. The excitement now became great, the dancing
stopped, and men and women joined in noisy acclamations.
A man bearing aloft an iron cradle full of flaming
rags, which had been lighted by the highest bidder, placed
them in the saucer at the top of the column and poured a
bottle of kerosene oil upon it. People now came forward
with offerings to be burned. These consisted, for the most
part, so far as I could judge, of old handkerchiefs and scarfs.
The theory is that they should be articles of value, covered
with gold and silver embroidery, and that, after they have
been committed to the flames, the residue of gold and silver
which remains should be scraped up and given to the poor;
but I doubt whether the residue of the rags which I saw
would amount in value to ten cents. Then the second bonfire
was lighted, and as both piles blazed up and shed their
lurid glow over the eager faces of swarthy men, with their
long ear-curls, and bedizened women, the scene was in the
highest degree novel and picturesque. The proceedings
were not, however, characterized by the gravity and harmony
befitting the occasion.
</p>

<p>
As I looked down upon the crowd from the steps upon
which I was standing, I observed suddenly a violent commotion,
which soon culminated in blows and sharp cries, and
the crowd began to surge violently to and fro. I failed to
discover the cause of the disturbance, but it was speedily
interrupted by a strong body of Turkish police, who rushed
in brandishing their muskets and laying about them with
the butt ends. The riot speedily subsided under this opportune
<span class="pageno target" title="161" id="page-161"></span>
display of energy, and the ringleaders were hustled
off with commendable promptness.
</p>

<p>
Meantime a somewhat similar ceremony was taking place
in the adjoining courtyard, where some wicker lamps were
being lighted. The pilgrims who filled this court were
Ashkenazim, and in their more European clothes they were
by no means so picturesque a crowd. It is a singular fact
that the Sephardim should be confined to one court and the
Ashkenazim to another. There is, indeed, very little sympathy
between the two great branches of the Jewish race
in Palestine. They live for the most part in different cities,
and have but little intercourse with each other. Thus, nearly
all the Jews in Tiberias are Sephardim, while those at
Safed are Ashkenazim.
</p>

<p>
The ceremonies which I have just described are a mild
edition of what was to take place on a far larger and more
important scale at Meron a week later, but as these latter
differ in no important respect from those which I witnessed,
I did not think it worth while to stay for them. Jews come
from great distances to take part in the burnings at Meron,
where a great number of bonfires are made in honour of the
numerous celebrated rabbis who are buried in the neighbourhood;
and here I was assured that articles of great value
are consumed, and the festivities are of a much more noisy
character, and last through the whole night instead of winding
up before midnight, as was the case at Tiberias. I did
not even prolong my stay till this hour, satisfied with having
assisted at ceremonies which prove that the Jewish in
not exempt from that tendency which characterizes all other
religions, of pandering to the grosser tastes of the masses.

<a href="#toc-32">HOUSE-BUILDING ON CARMEL.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Daliet-el-Carmel</span>, July 12.—Those readers who may
have read my letters from Palestine, may remember that
last year I took refuge from the summer heats at the village
of Esfia, on the highest point of Mount Carmel, where
I established a temporary camp. The disadvantage of living
under canvas is that, though it may secure you cool
nights, it affords but insufficient shelter from the noonday
sun. I therefore determined to build myself something more
substantial. My experiences of house-building on Carmel
have been both characteristic and instructive.
</p>

<p>
When I announced my intention to the villagers of Esfia,
they professed the greatest enthusiasm, and the owners of
the land which I had chosen for a site expressed their desire
to make me a present of it, so anxious did they pretend
to be that I should settle among them. I absolutely refused,
however, to receive anything as a gift, and told them to
name their price. This they modestly put at $650. As the
most trustworthy estimate I could obtain put its value at
$50, I said I would reconsider my original decision and accept
it as a gift. This seemed to afford them intense amusement.
Offers of this sort were merely complimentary, they
said, and meant nothing. I replied that the joke of offering
me the land for nothing was only equalled by their
asking me twelve times its value, which I should also consider
meant nothing. They came down at a bound to $250,
provided I would pay the costs of the transfer. This I
found to mean procuring them a valid title to the land,
which they admitted they had not got, and which it would
cost $50, expended in bribes to the government, to obtain.
I suggested that I might in that case expend the $50 in procuring
a valid title from the government in my own name,
and pay them nothing, seeing that, though theoretically,
<span class="pageno target" title="163" id="page-163"></span>
they were not practically, the owners of the land. This,
though it might possibly have been accomplished, would
have placed me in open warfare with the village. Rather
than live there under such conditions, I declined to have
anything more to do with people who had shown such dishonest
and grasping propensities. I will say, however, that
these were confined exclusively to the Christian section of
the population, who claimed the ownership of the site, and
that the Druses held themselves aloof and repudiated all
participation in the negotiations, expressing great indignation
at the conduct of the Christians, and offering me sites
elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
I was too disgusted with these latter, however, to be
tempted to live near them, and was casting about in despair
for an alternative, when one day I received a visit from the
Druse sheik of Dalieh, the only other village on Carmel,
and distant about thirteen miles from Haifa, who arrived
in great distress to tell me that his only son had just been
drawn as a conscript for the army, and that the whole family,
including his son's wife, whom I had remarked on the
occasion of a former visit as one of the most beautiful girls
I have ever seen, were thrown into the greatest grief, as
they were unable to pay the $250 which was required to
buy a substitute. I rode up to the village to inquire into
the matter, and, in return for the required sum, which I paid,
received a vineyard and garden of fruit-trees, with a good
title, and a site far surpassing in loveliness of situation that
which I had failed to secure at Esfia. The whole village
turned out <i>en masse</i> to express their gratitude and make
professions of service. As the village is exclusively Druse,
and does not contain a single Christian inhabitant, I felt
that these were to be relied upon; nor, so far, has this confidence
turned out misplaced. The sheik to whom I had
thus been able opportunely to render assistance, was the
spiritual head of the village. Its temporal affairs are managed
by another sheik. The site for my house was only divided
by a terrace from the little Druse place of worship,
where, however, the services are conducted under the strictest
secrecy. The whole hillside here is terraced with vines,
pomegranates, and wide-spreading fig-trees, at an altitude
<span class="pageno target" title="164" id="page-164"></span>
of thirteen hundred feet above the sea, which is distant as
the crow flies about five miles. It commands a magnificent
view of it and of the picturesque ruin of Athlit on its projecting
promontory, while a smiling valley, the sloping hills
of which are partially cultivated and partially covered with
copse-wood, winds down to a wild gorge between whose precipitous
cliffs one enters the plain of Sharon.
</p>

<p>
The difficulty in placing the house was to do so without
having to cut down any of the fig-trees that formed a sort
of bower in which we had to nestle, and which secures us
abundant thick shade. No sooner did we begin to excavate
for the foundations than we came upon huge, massive cut
blocks of stone, which evidenced the existence of some previous
building of great antiquity. Soon there turned up a
beautifully carved cornice, then a coin of one of the Constantines
of the period of the Byzantine Empire, then about
a dozen iron rings about two and a half inches in diameter,
attached to iron staples, and a quantity of nails about four
inches long, all heavily encrusted with rust. These were
dug up about two feet beneath the surface. Then came
handles of jars and fragments of pottery, some pieces of old
glass, one apparently the stem of a vase, and quantities of
tesseræ, showing the existence of a tessellated pavement
somewhere beneath. I was sorely tempted to diverge from
building into excavating, but I should have destroyed my
site, indefinitely postponed the erection of the house when
time was of the utmost value, and forfeited my contract
with the builder. So I have had to do the barbarous thing
of building on the top of what may be a most interesting
ruin, and of actually using the old foundations and some of
the stone which composed this house of the ancients.
</p>

<p>
The most of the stones of which the house is built come,
however, from the ruins of Dubil, the extensive remains of
which are about a mile distant. Here is the finest collection
of rock-cut tombs on Carmel; while the number and size of
the cisterns, the huge circular stones of the old olive-presses,
the basins carved in the solid rock as wine vats, the
fragments of columns, and the area over which the solid
foundations of the former town extend, prove that it contained,
in the most ancient times, a larger population than
<span class="pageno target" title="165" id="page-165"></span>
any other spot on the mountain. I am able to say this with
the more confidence as I have visited over twenty other
sites of ancient towns on Carmel. From this almost inexhaustible
quarry of old dwellings is my new one mainly constructed,
and thus do I live and move and have my being
amid the relics of a most remote past.
</p>

<p>
One of the most puzzling of these is an immense roller,
which I came upon in making a terrace for the veranda,
from which it now projects as a conspicuous ornament. It
is eight feet long, but one end has been a good deal broken,
and it may have been longer. It tapers very slightly at
both extremities, and is nine feet in circumference around
the centre, the ends being about two feet six in diameter.
It has four parallel lines of slots a little over two feet apart,
each slot about eight inches long and three deep, and two
wide at the top. There are four of these slots in each line,
and they are about eight inches apart. The whole mass
weighs probably from three to four tons. We had quite a
force of men to move it into its present position. I leave it
to the wise in such matters to conjecture what its possible
use may have been. I have seen others scattered about in
some of the ruins on the mountain, generally near olive-presses.
I think they had some reference to the crushing
apparatus.
</p>

<p>
But by far the most important find—and this was not
made until after the house was finished and we were clearing
up the débris—was an ancient cistern; and, as luck
would have it, it was just in the position in which I would
have put a cistern had this not appeared ready to hand,
thus saving me an expenditure of about $200. The aperture,
cut in the solid rock, is two feet three inches square.
It is then hollowed, demijohn shape, out of the rock to a
depth of fourteen feet, with an average breadth at the bottom
of twelve feet. In the bottom is a circular hole five
feet in diameter by three deep. This is evidently for cleaning
out the cistern, and is a good idea, which I should suggest
be adopted by us moderns. It is plain that if, instead
of having a flat bottom to a cistern, you have a hole in the
bottom into which you can sweep all the dirt, the process of
cleaning is simplified. It took four men several days to
<span class="pageno target" title="166" id="page-166"></span>
clean out this old cistern. It contained a great quantity of
fine mould, some broken earthenware jars, a good many
large stones, and a rather good fragment of a glass cup.
The old cement is still visible, about half an inch thick.
</p>

<p>
Besides the cistern, I have found a cave, formerly a tomb,
close to the house, which I shall use as a cellar, and store
away my wine in the stone coffins, or loculi, in which the
bones of some ancient characters have reposed. From all
which it will appear that house-building in Palestine, if it
is attended with the inconveniences arising from the backward
state of civilization, may nevertheless possess a charm
of its own.
</p>

<p>
If some of our appliances are rough-and-ready, they often
possess the merit of cheapness. Plastering, for instance,
is an expensive luxury; but the natives have a way of plastering
the walls which is nearly as good, and by no means
costly. This is entirely done by the women, who come and
sift soil, which they mix with cut straw and water, and
knead into a paste. When they have plastered the walls
and floor with this, they make another with a peculiar, fine
white clay, which they dig from certain places in the hillsides,
and, mixing this also with finely chopped straw, lay it
on as an outer covering. It makes a very pale yellow coating
for the walls, which is by no means unsightly. It is
not so good, however, for the floors, as it is said to give a
better harbour for fleas than another and more expensive
cement which is made with lime, and is called barbarica.
This is better also for the flat roofs, as it is more impervious
to water in the rainy season.
</p>

<p>
These roofs enable us to double our accommodations in a
most economical fashion. For instance, we have a guest
coming, and if the house is full, we build him a leaf hut on
the roof at the extravagant rate of 75 cents. These charming
little leaf huts, which can be made most snug and comfortable
when lined with mats, can be multiplied at will
over the whole roof, and the occupants have a cooler time
and a more extensive view than the dwellers in the stone
chambers beneath. As, however, in these climates air and
room add materially to comfort, our principal living-room is
thirty feet by twenty, and fifteen feet high, though I have
<span class="pageno target" title="167" id="page-167"></span>
not aspired to anything but a summer cottage, and the
whole cost has not exceeded $800.
</p>

<p>
In the eyes of the natives, this modest erection has
seemed something palatial. The people of Esfia have come
over, green with envy of their Dalieh rivals, and bitterly
reproaching themselves with the short-sighted cupidity which
has deprived them of the prestige which now attaches to
Dalieh, and filled with regret at the loss of the money which
would otherwise have been spent among them, while to the
Dalieh villagers it is a source of pride and delight. Whenever
any Druse sheik comes from a neighbouring village,
he is at once brought to see the sight. The consequence is
that I have no lack of visitors, and, foreseeing this, took care
to have a special apartment called a “liwan,” exclusively
devoted to their reception. They are thus barricaded from
the rest of the house. Otherwise, with the prying curiosity
which characterizes the race, privacy would be impossible.
As it is, from morning to night there is always a group
round the kitchen, much to the detriment of culinary operations
and the annoyance of the servants engaged in them.
Still, in order to keep on good terms, we have to make concessions,
to waste time over much drinking of coffee out of
minute cups, to hear their gossip on local politics, and, what
is still more difficult, to try and give them some larger ideas
than the very narrow ones which they have acquired upon
these wild hillsides.
</p>

<p>
Altogether, although their defects are of a somewhat trying
kind, and their essential insincerity makes them arrant
humbugs, they are rather pleasant humbugs, and, provided
they do not test one's affection by too many invitations to
dinner, which involves squatting on your heels and eating
with your fingers, the Druses are, taking them altogether,
by far the most agreeable class of people to live among in
Palestine.

<a href="#toc-33">DOMESTIC LIFE AMONG THE DRUSES.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Daliet-el-Carmel</span>, Aug. 1.—A residence in a Druse village
upon the familiar terms which I have now established
with the inhabitants of this one, opens up a phase of existence
so utterly foreign to all Western notions of domestic
life, and involves experiences so novel and characteristic,
that I am constantly receiving illustrations of the truth of
the saying that one half of the world has no idea how the
other half lives.
</p>

<p>
Early the other morning, for instance, my native servant
appeared in a state of no little excitement to tell me that
there had been a row in the night in the village, from which
my house is distant only a few hundred yards, and that a
young man was being killed. This was modified a few
minutes after by the arrival of some weeping females, who
said that if the young man could not find a place of refuge
somewhere he would be killed; and, as if to emphasize this
statement, no great interval elapsed before, on going out
into the kitchen, I found the young man in question clinging
to the legs of the kitchen table as though they were the
horns of the altar. He was a not very prepossessing-looking
young man of two or three and twenty, and on my appearance
he abandoned the legs of the table and rushed at
my hand, which he seized and kissed effusively. It is astonishing
how affectionate a man can become under the influence
of panic. I told him to go back to the table-legs
and hold on there, and consider himself perfectly safe. I
felt I could say this with a feeling of proud satisfaction,
for had I not the British government at my back, and is
not the British government celebrated for the chivalrous
promptitude with which it rushes to the rescue of those in
bodily peril?
</p>

<p>
Meantime I sent for the spiritual sheik of the village, as
<span class="pageno target" title="169" id="page-169"></span>
the secular one, who is the real supreme authority in such
matters, happened to be absent. Now, so far as I have
been able to ascertain, the whole village, consisting of some
five hundred souls, is related to the two sheiks, for the population
has gone on marrying and intermarrying till the relationships
are unfathomable. The young man in question
was the youngest of four brothers, and he had one sister
who had married the spiritual sheik's son. His mother, after
having this numerous family, had married the secular
sheik, who had himself had two sons by a former wife and
who has one daughter by his present one. You will observe
that the affair was already becoming mixed, and a strong
suspicion was gradually stealing over me that there was a
woman at the bottom of it. Such, indeed, proved to be the
case; in fact, there turned out to be two.
</p>

<p>
Now it happened, and this is not peculiar to the domestic
relations of the Druses, that the secular sheik's sons by his
first wife were very jealous of the children of their stepmother,
and hated that elderly lady herself with the cordial
hatred not unknown to stepchildren. They had contrived
so to embitter the family circle, that the secular sheik,
partly for the sake of peace, and partly, as I afterwards discovered,
for another reason, had banished her for two years
past from the marital roof; indeed, it had often been a matter
of surprise to me when calling on this sheik, or dining
with him, that I was always waited on by his daughter and
not by his wife.
</p>

<p>
Now the mystery was solved; but the sheik did not extend
this inhospitality to his stepsons, and the young man
now holding on to the kitchen table was especially favoured,
and, although not an inmate of his stepfather's house, made
himself too much at home there to suit his half-brothers.
They determined, therefore, to drive him forth. Now, the
sheik had another brother, who had a wife much younger
than himself, and who, it was whispered, was much admired
by the obnoxious young man. And it being the end of
Ramadan, and the village being in a state of nocturnal festivity,
people were in a mood for mischief all around, and,
rightly or wrongly, the young man being found in the
sheik's brother's house in the middle of the night, fell under
<span class="pageno target" title="170" id="page-170"></span>
grave suspicion, and a tremendous tumult took place,
in the course of which the sheik's son belaboured his stepmother,
being assisted thereto by his uncle; and here I may
incidentally remark that Druse men appear to think nothing
of beating their friends' wives, whose husbands seem to
think it quite natural they should do so. Perhaps it saves
them the trouble; anyhow, on this occasion the women gave
vent to their tongues, and the men retaliated with blows.
Of course, the women took the part of the gay but indiscreet
youth, who declared that he was in search of a missing
cow, though it was suggested with some force that to go
and look for her on the roof of the sheik's brother's house
after midnight showed an unpardonable ignorance of the
usual haunts of cows. The whole of the secular sheik's
first family, therefore, and their relations to the fifth degree,
who form the majority of the male population, refusing to
admit any such excuse, and considering the young man's
guilt proved, vowed to have his life, death being the not
uncommon penalty among them for a crime of this sort;
but the whole of the spiritual sheik's family, which seems
to me to consist principally of all the women in the village,
accepted the young man's version of the affair, and maintained
his innocence; and, with that knowledge of human
nature which characterizes the sex, they instinctively turned
to me as their natural ally, and hence I was saddled with the
protection of this too-susceptible and much-menaced youth.
</p>

<p>
The position was delicate, for though I am not insensible
to the advantage of possessing the suffrages of the female
part of the community, I desired also to stand well with the
males, and I felt that to interpose between them and the
object of their vengeance was likely to prejudice me in
their eyes. At the same time one could not turn a youth
out of one's kitchen to go like a sheep to the slaughter,
even though he may have been an erring lamb. Moreover,
when I came to hear the spiritual sheik's version of the
story, though it was undoubtedly one-sided, the question of
guilt did not appear to be satisfactorily established. So I
sent for the injured husband, and the sheik's son, who had
beaten his stepmother, to hear their version of the matter,
but they refused to answer my summons.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="171" id="page-171"></span>
</div>

<p>
Under these circumstances I determined to wait for the
return of the secular sheik, which took place the same evening.
After sympathizing with him on the distracted condition
of his household, I asked him if he could suggest the
best course of action for me to pursue, as it was evidently
impossible for me to board and lodge his stepson for an
indefinite time on the kitchen table. This, he admitted, was
an undue tax on my hospitality. I asked him if he could
not exercise sufficient authority over the members of his
own family to protect the life of his stepson. This, he said,
he could do while he remained in the village, but as he was
constantly being called away on business, he could not answer
for what might happen in his absence.
</p>

<p>
I then asked whether it might not be best to send the
young man away from the village until the storm had blown
over. I had suggested this to the spiritual sheik, but he
said that in that case the youth's mother would follow him;
and, as I remarked to the secular sheik, I was loath to
propose this to him, as it would separate him from his wife.
The sheik, with apparent distress, observed that his wife
did not see much of him. I asked whether I could not be
the means of healing this breach, and whether he would allow
me to send for his wife; this he at once assented to,
but the old lady refused to come. This refusal on her part
seemed to afford the sheik immense relief, seeing which, I
remarked, “Perhaps, if your wife did go away with your
stepson, you would not mind it very much.” “No,” he
said, “I should not mind it very much.”
</p>

<p>
I have since discovered that he is very anxious to get rid
of her, in order to marry some one else. So I packed the
young man off to a Christian of my acquaintance at Esfia,
two miles off, thinking his mother would follow him; but
not a bit. She has now taken up her abode with the spiritual
sheik, and I am at this moment employing her to make
a mud floor under a fig-tree, on which I intend to put beehives.
I rode over a few days ago to Esfia, and found the
young man comfortably installed with his Christian host,
who, with true Arab hospitality, charges him nothing for
his entertainment, but who will probably be indemnified for
it by a present from the spiritual sheik. Meantime, influences
<span class="pageno target" title="172" id="page-172"></span>
are at work to prepare the way for his safe return,
and I trust that I have so managed these delicate negotiations
as to secure me the good-will of both factions, though
I am afraid that the breach between them will never be
healed until the secular sheik divorces his present wife and
takes a fresh departure by uniting himself to the lady of his
affections.

<a href="#toc-34">CIRCASSIAN HIGHWAYMEN.—A DRUSE FESTIVAL
AT ELIJAH'S ALTAR.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Daliet-el-Carmel</span>, Aug. 15.—About this time last year,
when I was at Esfia, we were suddenly disturbed by the
intelligence that a German teamster, whom I have been in
the habit of employing, had been attacked in the night at
the bridge over the Kishon, distant about three miles from
my camp, while on his way from Haifa to Nazareth, by four
Circassians, who, suddenly surrounding him, pointed their
guns at his head, thus preventing him from using his revolver,
which they stole from him, at the same time cutting
the traces of his team and carrying off a valuable pair of
horses, leaving the poor man helpless with his wagon at
about one o'clock in the morning, far from any help, but
thankful to have escaped with his life.
</p>

<p>
The whole machinery of the local police was put in motion,
and the authorities professed to take up the matter in
earnest. Some of the German colonists scoured the country
in pursuit of the robbers, who appear to have fled to
some Circassian colonies which were established about five
years ago on the plains of Iturea, near the foot of Hermon,
beyond the Jordan, and there all trace of them was lost.
They had got among friends, who covered their tracks, and
the horses were never recovered.<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>
Since this time the colonists, who are constantly travelling
in their wagons between Haifa and Nazareth, and in
the hottest weather generally make the journey by night,
always go two or three together, and had not been molested
until a few nights ago, when two of them started for Nazareth,
one of them the victim of last year. His companion,
who had left Haifa a little before him, expecting to be
shortly overtaken, was jogging along at about 8 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>, and
<span class="pageno target" title="174" id="page-174"></span>
was not above four miles distant from Haifa, when a Circassian
rode past him, wishing him good-evening. The
German returned the salute, but his suspicions were roused
by the man's manner, and he got his revolver ready. Almost
immediately after he heard a whistle, the man who
had passed him turned sharply back, and two others sprang
upon him from an ambush, where they had been concealed,
by the roadside. One of them seized his horses' heads, while
the others began cutting the traces. The teamster instantly
jumped from the box, and, unwilling to shoot before it was
absolutely necessary, closed with one of the robbers, striking
at him with the butt of his pistol. He was, however,
nearly overpowered, and had just time, as he saw his adversary
draw a knife, to send a bullet through him. At
this moment he received a severe blow on the back from
one of the other men, who rushed to the assistance of his
comrade, but the German, who was an old soldier and had
been through the Franco-German campaign, was a quick
shot, and knocked this man over with a second barrel. At
this moment a fourth Circassian appeared upon the scene.
Fortunately, the attacking party were only armed with
knives. The two remaining Circassians now, seeing that
two of their number had been disposed of, began to draw
off their bodies, it being a first principle of their warfare to
carry away their dead. This gave the German, who was
scarcely able to raise himself from the ground, a chance to
fire two more shots, but, as it seemed at the time, without
effect, and the two Circassians, throwing the bodies of their
companions over their horses, made off.
</p>

<p>
By this time the other German teamster, who had been
a quarter of a mile behind, but had pushed on on hearing
the shots, came up and helped his wounded friend. He,
however, was able to continue his journey to Nazareth,
and in a few days recovered from the effects of his
bruises. Meantime information has been received from
a peasant where the Circassians passed the night, that one
of them had been killed on the spot, that another died of
his wound shortly after he was brought to his cottage, and
that the third had a ball through his leg, but that his wound
had not been sufficiently serious to prevent his continuing
<span class="pageno target" title="175" id="page-175"></span>
his journey the following night with the corpses of his
companions. One would think, under these circumstances,
that if the authorities chose there could be no great difficulty
in tracing the miscreants; but no steps whatever have
been taken in the matter, which is, perhaps, the best solution
of it, for whenever a foreigner is unhappily obliged to
kill a native in self-defence in this country the chance is
that he has to stand his trial on a counter charge of murder.
Now, thanks to the precautions taken by the Circassians,
and the apathy of the government, there is no proof of any
one having been killed, and the Circassians have received a
much severer punishment than any that would have been
inflicted upon them for horse-stealing by the authorities, and
they are likely to be careful how they meddle again with
the Germans.
</p>

<p>
Opinions are divided as to whether they will seek their
revenge or not. The Germans still continue to team by
night to Nazareth, but they go in parties of never less than
three wagons together, and well armed. Had the robbers
been Bedouins or native Arabs, this encounter would mean
a blood feud, and sooner or later revenge would be taken;
but I once spent some weeks with the Circassians in their
own country, and I do not think that they have the same
custom of vendetta. Indeed, notwithstanding the fact that
they are a most lawless and thieving set as colonists, I
found them a very safe and pleasant people to travel among
in their own mountains, where they have their code of
honour and hospitality, and I have spent a day with them in
one of their colonies beyond Jordan, and received nothing
but civility. It would, however, be better to keep them in
those wild and half-savage regions than bring them within
range of the temptations which civilization offers to them.
</p>

<p>
I have just seen a man who has been paying them a
visit at the old city of Jerash, which, with the exception of
Palmyra, is the most perfect Greco-Roman ruin which exists
to the east of Baalbec. My informant tells me that in the
course of their excavations for stone for their habitations
they are making great discoveries. They have unearthed a
heretofore undiscovered and unsuspected temple, with a
subterranean conduit of flowing water, and many fragments
<span class="pageno target" title="176" id="page-176"></span>
of statues and coins. One large jar of gold coins, worth
$50 each, was an immense prize, which they only succeeded
in keeping by paying a bribe to the government official of
$2500. My informant saw one of these coins, but, as he
was a native, and ignorant of such matters, his description
was too vague to convey any definite idea of their date. I
should feel much tempted to pay these ruins, which I have
already examined once, another visit, but of late years the
government throws so many obstacles in the way of travellers
to the east of the Jordan that such a journey now may
expose one to annoyances.
</p>

<p>
Meantime, there are many objects of interest in this immediate
neighbourhood; within a distance of three miles I
have found the extensive remains of what have been undoubtedly
iron and copper mines. The former ore was
present in large quantities, and the day may come when
this discovery may prove of considerable value to this part
of the country, though it would be useless, under existing
conditions, to take any steps towards its exploration now. It
is probable that the old iron rings which I found in digging
the foundations of my house were made from this ore.
</p>

<p>
I have also found a curious square structure, fourteen
feet in height, twelve feet square, composed of stones averaging
three feet by two, by about one in thickness, all carefully
squared, and laid one upon another without cement,
the whole forming a perfectly solid erection of great antiquity.
It may possibly have been a vineyard watch-tower.
It is on the way from here to the “Place of Burning,”
or Elijah's sacrifice, and is the second I have found
in that neighbourhood, the other being considerably smaller.
I came upon it accidentally on the occasion of a Druse
picnic to which I was invited, and which took place at the
“Place of Burning,” in celebration of the last day of the
feast of Ramadan, which the Druses seem to observe as
well as the Moslems, though on a different day.
</p>

<p>
The female population of the village, in their gayest
dresses, had preceded us on donkeys. I accompanied the
sheik, who had drawn up on a little plain outside the town
about a dozen horsemen as an escort, and thus, after a little
of the usual imitation of the equestrian game of the djerrid,
<span class="pageno target" title="177" id="page-177"></span>
at which, in default of the real thing, the horsemen delight
to exercise their horses by a mock encounter, we formed in
a sort of procession, the young men of the village on foot,
armed with great clubs, chanting songs of love and war,
as they marched in front. There were from two to three
hundred persons collected on the flat space in front of the
church which the Carmelite monks have recently erected on
the supposed site of Elijah's altar. And here the usual
dancing-circles were formed, and the fun of the day commenced.
But it was melancholy fun. How could it be
otherwise, when the young men and women are not allowed
to dance together, scarcely even to speak to one another?
It was quite pitiful to see half a dozen of the prettiest girls
that could be found in Syria sitting under the shade of a
tree, gossiping, and looking at half a dozen fine, stalwart,
handsome young fellows prancing about on their horses, or
singing and dancing, without there being the ghost of a
chance of a flirtation. The girls cooked together and ate
together and danced together and sang together, and the
young men amused themselves apart as best they could.
As the delights of flirting are unknown to them, I suppose
they did not miss them; but as I looked at the young people
of both sexes thus divided, I wondered what would be
the result of a similar experiment if it were tried at an
American picnic.
</p>

<p>
It was a curious sight to see a bevy of at least fifty women
and girls rush into the Carmelite chapel, which during
the week is left in charge of a Druse, who on this occasion
did the honours of it to his coreligionists, who scampered
all over the premises, gazing wonderingly at the altar ornaments,
and forming large dancing-circles on the flat
roof. I could not exactly find out why the Druses chose
the place of Elijah's sacrifice as the scene of their festivity,
but there is no doubt that the traditions of a special sanctity
are attached to it in their religion as well as in that of
the Roman Catholics, and that the slaughter of the eight
hundred false prophets by the holy man whose prayers for
rain were heard on this spot, and upon whom the divine vengeance
was invoked, appeals to a sentiment which is common
to the Christian, the Moslem, and the Druse religions.

A year later the thieves were found, and the Circassian colony to which
they belonged was compelled by the government to refund the Germans the
value of the horses.

<a href="#toc-35">ARMAGEDDON.—THE BOSNIAN COLONY AT
CÆSAREA.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Daliet-el-Carmel</span>, Sept. 11.—There is no fact at
first more puzzling to the traveller in Palestine than the
contrast between the misery and poverty of the fellahin
and the extent and fertility of land owned by each village.
This is, however, the inevitable result of the various fiscal
devices to which the government has been compelled to resort,
in order to provide a revenue which shall meet the
needs of its internal administration, and the claims of its
foreign bondholders. These press more severely on the
peasant class than on any other in the community, and as
the financial necessities of the empire increase, new methods
are being constantly devised to meet them. Thus
the latest arrangement requires the taxes to be paid in
money instead of in kind, as heretofore, the amount being
assessed on an average of the crops extending over a period
of five years. This has produced the greatest consternation
among the peasantry throughout the country, who find themselves
quite unable to meet this new demand, and who are
compelled, in consequence, to resort to extortionate money-lenders,
who charge from thirty to forty per cent. for their
advances, thus ruining the fellahin, whose villages are all
destined by this process to fall into the hands of these grasping
usurers, while the peasants remain upon them as serfs,
merely receiving so much of the crop as will keep them
from starving. Thus it happened that, in the belief that I
had more bowels of compassion than their own countrymen,
I was applied to by the villagers in all directions; among
others, by those who owned the lands of Lejjun, or the biblical
Megiddo. This is generally supposed to be identical
with Armageddon, and the notion of becoming the proprietor
of a battle-field which possesses such interesting historical
<span class="pageno target" title="179" id="page-179"></span>
associations in the past, to say nothing of the future,
which may be mythical or not, according to theological
fancy, induced me to pay a visit to that celebrated locality.
Its position was as tempting as its sentimental considerations
were remarkable. Here, jutting out into the plain of Esdrælon,
of which it commands an extensive view, stands the
Tell et Mutsellim, or governor's hill, upon which the traces
of what may have been a palace are distinctly visible. Right
opposite to us across the plain, about twelve miles distant,
the houses of Nazareth gleam upon the lofty hillside; to
the right are Tabor, Little Hermon, and Mount Gilboa, with
the mountains of Gilead in the rear. Beneath, circling round
the base of the mound, are “the waters of Megiddo,” a
copious stream, turning two water-mills and irrigating an
extensive tract of plain. Behind us is an undulating plateau
covered with the ruins of the ancient city. Here are fragments
of columns, carved capitals and cornices, and I found
some subterranean chambers into which I crawled, and
which, as they connected with the stream by stone conduits,
I assume must, in old times, have been baths. The peasants
have found antiques of various kinds, and I was shown the
hand and forearm of a female figure, life-size, and beautifully
carved in marble, which they had dug up. There is
no saying what treasures the fortunate proprietor of this
place may not unearth, and with the wealth of water at his
command, of which but little advantage is now taken, he
might have extensive gardens and orange groves. From
this point a great military road passed, in the most
ancient times, connecting Galilee with the coast road.
Along it, before the conquest of Canaan by the Israelites,
Thothmes, the King of Egypt, led his invading hosts into
Syria. Here, by “the waters of Megiddo,” was fought the
great battle between Barak and Sisera, when the stars
in their courses fought against Sisera; and on the same
ground, six centuries later, the hosts of Pharaoh Necho
met the army of Josiah, King of Judah, and vanquished
it, while the king himself, being “sore wounded” as he
rode in his chariot, was carried away to Jerusalem to
die.
</p>

<p>
On making inquiries of a practical kind in regard to the
<span class="pageno target" title="180" id="page-180"></span>
present financial position of this property and its peasant
owners, I began to suspect that any foreigner who desired
to become its possessor would find himself involved in a
struggle of a different kind from that of which in past
times it has been the scene, and one more consonant with
the spirit of the age in which we live. The invasion of
Palestine of late years by foreigners of all religions and
nationalities, the constant influx of Jews, and the increasing
attention which the Holy Land is concentrating upon itself,
has so far alarmed the Porte that foreigners are practically
prohibited from purchasing any more land in the country;
and the peasantry of the villages who applied to me for assistance
were informed that, even if I were prepared to lend
them money, they were not to be allowed to borrow. I
was thus relieved of the great annoyance of having constantly
to refuse applications, which, under any circumstances,
I could not have satisfied.
</p>

<p>
From Megiddo I followed the historical highway through
the mountain, which, in the days of Christ, when Cæsarea
was rising into its grandeur, must have been one of the
most frequented routes in the country. The road led
through charmingly diversified scenery. I turned off from
it to ascend to the town of Umm-el-Fahm, an important
place, containing about two thousand inhabitants, situated
on copse-clothed hills, at an elevation of fifteen hundred
feet above the level of the sea, and commanding extensive
views. Here I was the guest of a local millionaire, noted
for his penurious habits and his grasping nature. His ragged
appearance and humble establishment did not belie his
reputation. I had, however, no reason to complain, for, if
the accommodation was rough, his intentions were certainly
hospitable.
</p>

<p>
The romantic valleys by which the village is surrounded
are thickly planted with olive groves, which contain over a
hundred thousand trees, and are a great source of revenue.
While, when they are too far from the village for the protection
of any crop, the hillsides and summits are clothed
with a dense undergrowth of scrub oak, terebinth, and other
shrubs, which are only prevented from becoming forest trees
by the charcoal-burners; but their quick growth testifies to
<span class="pageno target" title="181" id="page-181"></span>
the richness of the soil. To the north the range extends for
fifteen miles, to the base of Carmel. The woodland disappears,
and is succeeded by rolling chalk downs, affording
magnificent pasturage and good arable land, for it is well
watered, and from its temperate and healthy climate is
called the “breezy land.”
</p>

<p>
The villages here are small, few, and far between, and
there is room for a large population; but the most tempting
land of all is the tract between Umm-el-Fahm and the sea,
where the oak-trees which are scattered over the pastures
and cornfields attain a large growth, and the country presents
the appearance of an immense park. From an artistic
point of view the woods and the farm lands are so combined
as to form the most perfectly diversified scenery, just
where the rolling hills slope gently down into the plain of
Sharon. It was across this country that our road lay to
Cæsarea, which was our objective point, first, through the
thick copse of the upper valleys, and so out upon the park-like
uplands, where the whole population was out in the
fields gathering the crops, which strings of camels were conveying
to the village threshing-floors. Here and there was
a money-lender from Acre or Beyrout, squatting under an
umbrella, to see that the peasantry did not rob him of his
share. This is a busy time with these gentry, who are the
bloodsuckers of the fellahin, to whom they advance money
at exorbitant rates of interest, while the latter, in revenge,
resort to every conceivable device to conceal from them the
real extent of the crop, and to make the proportion coming
to them as small as possible.
</p>

<p>
At one village called Arareh I found three old Roman
arches, a fine fragment of a column, and some rock-cut
tombs, which seem hitherto to have escaped observation.
The remains indicate that it must have been a place of considerable
importance, but I have not yet been able to identify
it. The plain of Sharon, where we struck it, is being
by degrees brought into cultivation, partly by colonists,
Circassian and Bosnian, and partly by native capitalists.
The peasantry themselves are rapidly losing all proprietorship
in the soil, unable to contend against the exactions of
the government tax-gatherer, on the one hand, and of the
<span class="pageno target" title="182" id="page-182"></span>
usurious money-lender, on the other; but while they are
yearly becoming more impoverished and dependent, the
wealth of the country is steadily increasing, and its development
must follow as a matter of course, though, in accordance
with the tendencies of modern civilization, it will be
at the expense of the masses.
</p>

<p>
I went to lunch with the largest of these local magnates.
He was a Turk, and spoke Turkish in preference to Arabic.
He had, as may be supposed, little sympathy with the Arab
peasantry, who were practically his serfs, and their condition
was by no means improved by their lands having fallen
into his hands. On the other hand, they never would
have introduced the civilized iron ploughs with which he
was bringing land into cultivation. His farm-house was a
large, straggling, isolated building, which stood on a hillock
in the plain, with extensive outhouses and dependencies,
not unlike the residence of a Southern planter, while, curiously
enough, a large proportion of his farm hands consisted
of African negroes located in a village hard by—but
he had none of the lavish hospitality which characterized
the landed proprietors of the South.
</p>

<p>
A ride of an hour over a part of the plain which, from
the peculiar quality of its soil, is exclusively devoted to the
growth of water-melons, hitherto the sole export of the little
haven of Cæsarea, brought me to that spot. Although
the remains of the old port have been used as a harbour for
coasting craft, these ruins have not been inhabited since
they were evacuated by the crusaders at the end of the
thirteenth century. Indeed, there is a curious prediction
connected with them, to the effect that the rebuilding of
a town here would immediately precede a great disaster
to Islam. It has been in consequence of this, as I have
understood, that while villages have sprung up on all the
other crusading ruins on the coast, this one alone has remained
untenanted. However this may be, the spell is
broken now, for about six months ago the first instalment
of a band of refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina
arrived here, having been allotted this ruin and the lands
surrounding it by the government, as the nucleus of a new
colony.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="183" id="page-183"></span>
</div>

<p>
Apart from the great interest which these extensive ruins
must ever have from an antiquarian point of view, I was
anxious to visit Cæsarea to judge for myself of the prospects
of this embryo colony, and make personal acquaintance
with this new and interesting class of immigrants.
Moreover, as the new town is to be built upon the ruins
of the old, it was evident that I should never have another
chance of seeing what these were like. They have already
during the last twenty years served as a quarry from whence
the magnificent building-stones, cut originally by Herod the
Great when he built the town, have been transported in
thousands of boat-loads to Acre and Jaffa. The ruins have
therefore lost much of the pristine grandeur which is described
in the records of travellers in the early part of the
present century. In a few years more they will probably
have disappeared altogether. The subterranean treasures,
whatever they may be, will, however, remain untouched,
and the Schliemann of a future age will find here the
traces of five successive epochs of civilization. On the top
he will find the ruins of the stone houses of the Bosnians
and Herzegovinians, now in process of erection; below
them the foundations of the great Crusading fortress, and
below them again the remains of the first Mohammedan
period; beneath them, traces of the Byzantine period, and,
at the bottom, the tessellated pavements, the fragments
of carved marble, the statuary, and the coins of the Roman
period.
</p>

<p>
Meantime it is a singular fact that the strip of coast from
Haifa to Cæsarea seems to have become a centre of influx
of colonists and strangers of the most diverse races. The
new immigrants to Cæsarea are Slavs. Some of them
speak a little Turkish. Arabic is an unknown tongue to
them, which they are learning. Their own language is a
Slav dialect. When the troubles in the provinces of Bosnia
and Herzegovina first broke out, which led to the Russo-Turkish
war, a howl of indignation went up from the philanthropists
on both sides of the Atlantic, but especially
from the Radical party in England, against the Turkish
government, for its persecution of the Slav population of
the Danubian provinces. Nor do I think that the general
<span class="pageno target" title="184" id="page-184"></span>
public have yet realized the fact that of these Slavs more
than half were Moslem, and that the Turkish government
was not persecuting them more than it was persecuting
any other of its subjects, but that the persecutors of the
Slav peasantry, who were Christian, were the Slav aristocracy,
who were Moslem. It was, in fact, not a question
of an oppressed nationality, but a strictly agrarian question
between people of the same race. When it was settled by
handing over the provinces to Austria, the Slav-Moslem
aristocracy, finding themselves in their turn persecuted by
their former peasants and the Christian power which protected
them, migrated to the more congenial rule of the
sultan. So the curious spectacle is presented of a Slav population
migrating from Austrian rule to Asia, in order to be
under a Moslem government.
</p>

<p>
Close beside the new Bosnian colony there are planted in
the plain of Sharon two or three colonies of Circassians.
These are the people who committed the Bulgarian atrocities.
The irony of fate has now placed them within three
or four miles of colonists belonging to the very race they
massacred. They, too, fleeing from government by Christians,
have sought refuge under the sheltering wing of the
sultan, where, I regret to say, as I described in a former letter,
they still indulge in their predatory propensities. In
immediate proximity to them are the black tents of a tribe
of Turcomans. They belong to the old Seljuk stock, and
the cradle of their tribe gave birth to the present rulers of
the Turkish Empire. They have been here for about three
hundred years, and have forgotten the Turkish language,
but a few months ago a new migration arrived from the
mountains of Mesopotamia. These nomads spoke nothing
but Turkish, and hoped to find a warm welcome from their
old tribesmen on the plain of Sharon. In this they were
disappointed, and they have now, to my disgust, pitched
their tents on some of the spurs of Carmel, where their
great hairy camels and their own baggy breeches contrast
curiously with the camels and costumes of the Bedouins
with whom we are familiar.
</p>

<p>
Besides the Slavs, the Circassians, and the Turcomans,
we have the Jewish colony of Zimmarin, distant about
<span class="pageno target" title="185" id="page-185"></span>
ten miles from Cæsarea; the German colony at Haifa, and
the Druse villages on Carmel, making, with the Bedouins,
the negroes, and the native fellahin, no fewer than nine
different races engaged in the cultivation of the soil in this
neighbourhood.

<a href="#toc-36">CÆSAREA.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Daliet-el-Carmel</span>, Oct. 2.—The habit of tourists of visiting
only those spots in Palestine called holy places, or to
which some striking Biblical association is attached, causes
them to neglect ruins of the highest historical interest, and
which are often as well worth seeing from a picturesque as
from an archæological point of view. They make an effort
to go to Nazareth, which differs in no respect from an ordinary
Syrian town, and which does not boast a single object
of antiquarian interest, while they omit from their programme,
because it is not included in the books, a ruin
like Cæsarea, a city unsurpassed for grandeur and magnificence
by anything in Palestine when Herod raised it to the
dignity of a metropolis, and the scene of many important
events, both Biblical and historical. Here Peter baptized
the first Gentile convert to Christianity; here Philip lived
with his four daughters, engaged in missionary work;
here Paul preached before Felix, and “almost persuaded”
Agrippa to become a Christian. It was in the theatre, the
remains of which are still to be seen, that Herod made his
oration to the multitude when “the angel of the Lord
smote him, and he was eaten of worms and gave up the
ghost.” It was in the streets of Cæsarea that, on the occasion
of a quarrel between the Greek and Jewish population,
twenty thousand Jews were massacred. Here the celebrated
historians Eusebius and Procopius were born, and here
was found, when the city was taken by the crusaders, the
hexagonal vase of green crystal which was supposed to contain
the Holy Grail.
</p>

<p>
The old Roman wall can be traced for a mile and a half,
enclosing an area strewn with the remains of a theatre, hippodrome,
temple, aqueducts, and mole; while a second line
of fortification, still in admirable preservation, and over
<span class="pageno target" title="187" id="page-187"></span>
half a mile in extent, marks the <i>enceinte</i> of the old Crusading
fortress, with its castle and donjon keep, its cathedral,
its Northern church, and harbour. This tendency on the
part of travellers is the more to be regretted as the opportunity
of examining these extensive ruins is now about to
pass away, never again to return.
</p>

<p>
The Slav colonists, whose immigration I described in my
last letter, are laying out broad streets right across the most
interesting ruins, using the old foundations, appropriating
the beautiful masonry, the white stones which formed the
temple built by Herod, and the brown limestone blocks of
the cathedral of the crusaders, quarrying into ancient buildings
beneath the surface of the ground, levelling down the
ruins at one place, levelling them up in another, and so utterly
transforming the whole picturesque area that it will
soon be no longer recognizable. Within five months over
twenty good stone houses have been built, some of three
stories high, others with vaults for merchandise and storing
grain; in some cases the old Crusading vaults, evidently
used for the same purpose, have been made available.
The dwellings are being built on the plan which renders the
towns of the Moslem Slavs of European Turkey so dull and
uninteresting; they are all enclosed with courtyards, the
high stone walls of which jealously guard the harems of the
proprietors. In this respect these western Mohammedans
are far more particular than the Arabs, who allow their
women comparative freedom; but during the period of my
stay in Cæsarea I did not see one of the female colonists.
</p>

<p>
Their male belongings, however, were most hospitable,
especially when they found that I knew their country and
was familiar with Mostar and Cognitza, in the neighbourhood
of which towns had been their former homes. They
were the landed aristocracy of their own country, and have,
therefore, brought a considerable amount of wealth with
them. A large tract of the most fertile land of the plain of
Sharon has been donated to them by the Turkish government,
and there can be no doubt that the country will gain
by their settlement in it. In manners and costume they
form a marked contrast to the natives, who are evidently
much impressed by their wealth and dignity.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="188" id="page-188"></span>
</div>

<p>
The lower or peasant class of Bosnia and Herzegovina
were not obliged, when the country was conquered by the
Moslems, to change their religion, and they have continued
Christians; while the descendants of their masters, who remained
the proprietors of the soil, became bigoted Mussulmans.
The consequence has been that now that the country
has been handed over to the Austrians, the Christian
peasantry have naturally found protection from the authorities
against the oppression of their former masters, who,
unable to endure the humiliation of seeing the tables turned,
and their old servants enabled to defy them with impunity,
have sold all their possessions and migrated to the dominions
of the sultan, rather than endure the indignities to
which they declare they were exposed from their new Christian
rulers and their old Christian serfs—very much on the
same principle that the Southern States became intolerable
to some of the landed proprietors after the emancipation of
their slaves. Whether they will agree with their Circassian
neighbours remains yet to be seen. They form the
<i>avant garde</i> of a much larger migration which is to follow
as soon as arrangements can be made to receive them. One
of the leading men, who has opened a store, assigned me an
unfinished house as a lodging, and said that he intended to
enlarge it into a hotel for travellers.
</p>

<p>
It is worthy of the notice of intending travellers in Palestine
next season that they can now drive the whole way,
if they wish, in wagons belonging to the German colonists,
from Jerusalem to Nazareth, in four easy days, instead of
having to ride, and camp in tents as heretofore. There are
excellent hotels at Jaffa. The next stopping-place would,
now that accommodation is promised there, be Cæsarea, the
next day to Haifa, where the hotel is being enlarged and
put on a thoroughly comfortable and European basis, and
the next day to Nazareth, where good quarters can be obtained
at the convent, but where, if this route comes to be
adopted, a hotel will doubtless shortly be built. As soon
as travellers give up their present expensive habit of travelling
through Palestine with tents, the hotel accommodation
will be increased, and the existing carriage roads, as well as
the vehicles which traverse them, be improved. The government
<span class="pageno target" title="189" id="page-189"></span>
has recently determined to construct a carriage
road along the coast from Acre to Beyrout and Tripoli,
which, if it is carried out, will alter all the existing conditions
of travel.
</p>

<p>
The most striking features of the ruins of Cæsarea are
the Crusading castle and the old Roman mole. The former
is built upon a long, narrow reef or breakwater, partly artificial,
which runs out into the sea for one hundred and sixty
yards, forming the southern side of the harbour, while the
northern side is formed by a sort of mole or jetty more than
two hundred feet long, which is composed of some sixty or
seventy prostrate columns lying side by side in the water
like rows of stranded logs. They are from five to twenty
feet in length, and average about eighteen inches in diameter.
I never in my life before saw such an array of granite
pillars so closely piled together or used for such a purpose.
Indeed, to judge by those which remain, Cæsarea must have
been a city of columns. The crusaders used them to thorough-bind
their walls, from which the butts project like
rows of cannon from the side of a man-of-war. They must
have built many hundreds of old Roman columns thus into
their fortification.
</p>

<p>
The Crusading wall enclosing the town rises from a moat
which is about forty feet wide, but, being much filled in
with rubbish, is not more than five or six feet deep. The
wall itself is about nine feet thick, with buttresses at intervals
which are from thirty to fifty feet long and project
from twenty to twenty-six feet; but it is especially in the
castle and donjon, which is built out into the sea on the
projecting reef, that the columns are used as thorough-bonds.
Some of these are of red granite, others of gray. The Bosnian
colonists are perching a <i>café</i> on the ruins of the old
donjon, immediately above two magnificent prostrate columns
of red granite, nine feet long and four in diameter.
I observed here also a finely polished block of red granite
over six feet square and three feet six inches thick. There
is also a curious double tessellated pavement, evidently of
two periods, as the upper tesseræ are at least six inches
above the lower ones. I am afraid, as the masons are working
immediately above them, they will soon disappear, as
<span class="pageno target" title="190" id="page-190"></span>
will also a beautiful carved capital in white marble. I
scrambled up to the top of this picturesque ruin, where the
rib of the groined roof of the upper chamber still remains
supported on a corbel in the form of a human head, and
looked out of the pointed, arched window sheer down seventy
feet on the sea, beating against the base of the sea
wall. The mouth of the small artificial harbour is about
two hundred yards across, but the latter is too much exposed
and too small ever to be of much value.
</p>

<p>
Among the Roman remains, the hippodrome, the theatre,
and the aqueduct are the most interesting. The first is a
sunken level space about three hundred yards long by one
hundred wide, surrounded by a mound, and in the middle
are three truncated blocks of red granite, which, when standing
on each other, must have formed a conical pillar about
nine feet high and seven feet diameter at the base. There
is also another fine block of red granite nearly forty feet
long and four feet in diameter, which has been broken.
The theatre is a semicircular building of masonry in an immense
artificial mound, surrounded by a trench near the sea.
It is mentioned by Josephus as capable of containing a large
number of persons. Indeed, the account by this historian
of the building of this city by Herod the Great, which I
have just been reading, is most interesting. It occupied
twelve years, and was finished thirteen years before Christ.
He says that the stones of which the sea wall was built were
fifty feet in length, eighteen in breadth, and nine in depth.
</p>

<p>
For nearly six hundred years it was a Christian city and
the seat of an archbishop, then for five hundred years it fell
under Moslem rule, and an Arab traveller in <span class="sc small">A.D.</span> 1035 describes
it as “an agreeable city, irrigated with running water
and planted with date palms and oranges, surrounded
by a strong wall pierced by an iron gate, and containing a
fine mosque.” Then for one hundred and fifty years it remained
a Crusading stronghold, while its final and complete
destruction by the Sultan Bibars took place in 1265 <span class="sc small">A.D.</span>,
since which time it has remained a howling wilderness. I
have dwelt somewhat fully on the present aspect of the
ruins, as the transformation they are undergoing will soon
be complete.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="191" id="page-191"></span>
</div>

<p>
From Cæsarea I followed the coast northward with the
high-level aqueduct, which in places is still in tolerably
good preservation, on my right. This aqueduct was the
chief source of the water supply for the inhabitants. It
was eight miles long, and at one point tunnels the rock for
a quarter of a mile, thirty feet below its surface. There
was also a low-level aqueduct, three miles long, which drew
its water supply from the Crocodile River. At some seasons
this is a dangerous stream to ford, though I experienced
no difficulty. That it is not misnamed I possess indisputable
proof, for a few weeks ago an Arab acquaintance
presented me with a piece of crocodile skin about a foot
square, cut from the hide of a crocodile which he himself
helped to kill in this river. Passing Tantura, which also
contains some Crusading ruins and rock-cut tombs, I reached
the Jewish colony of Zimmarin, which I had not visited for
eighteen months, and where I was pleased to find the colony
in a thriving condition, the colonists hopeful, industrious,
and contented, the crops promising fairly, and their progress
only checked by the refusal of the government to allow
them to build permanent dwellings, a difficulty which
it is hoped may be overcome by a judicious display of firmness
and patience.

<a href="#toc-37">VILLAGE FEUDS.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Daliet-el-Carmel</span>, Oct. 15.—In order to really understand
this country, to become acquainted with the inner
life of its inhabitants, to familiarize one's self with their
manners and customs, their necessities, and their aspirations,
such as they are, and to arrive at a true estimate of the national
character, it is needful to remove one's self from any
centre of so-called civilization, however crude, and to live
among them, as I have been doing for the last three months
and a half, not as a stranger, but as a villager owning property,
identified with their local interests, and with a will
to afford them such practical counsel and aid as may lie in
one's power. People wonder what I can find to do in a remote
Druse village in the back parts of Carmel; but in
practice the days are not long enough to deal with the
varied interests that crowd into them.
</p>

<p>
Scarcely a day passes that visitors do not arrive from
some of the surrounding villages—sheiks of high or low degree,
as the case may be—generally with polite invitations
that I should return their visits, which I know from experience
means a financial proposition of some sort in reserve,
for all the villages are more or less embarrassed in their pecuniary
circumstances, and have been so victimized by the
native money-lenders of Haifa that they eagerly turn towards
any one who they think possesses bowels of compassion.
</p>

<p>
The return visits which these invitations involve are often
highly characteristic in their attendant circumstances, and
in the varied incidents which accompany them; and, besides,
they give one an opportunity of becoming minutely acquainted
with the neighbourhood, and afford one an insight
into the motives by which Oriental human nature is actuated.
There is, for instance, a village about four miles from here,
<span class="pageno target" title="193" id="page-193"></span>
so beautifully situated among its olive groves, as seen from
a distance, that I had long intended paying it a visit, and
wondered why its sheik had never come to make my acquaintance.
The mystery was explained one day by an old
woman whose extreme poverty had induced me to employ
her as a water-carrier. On asking how she had become so
destitute, she said that she was a widow, and that her only
son and support had been waylaid and murdered some
months previously by some of the young men of the village
in question. All her efforts to obtain justice had been unavailing,
and since then the two villages had not been on
visiting terms.
</p>

<p>
As none of the inhabitants of Dalieh would accompany
me, I found my own way one day to the village, to try and
discover the rights of the story. I was received with great
politeness by a tall, gentlemanlike man, whom I supposed
to be the sheik, but who turned out to be the very individual
who had been accused of the murder. Soon the sheik
and a number of village notables arrived, and, seated around
the neatly-matted guest-chamber, we exchanged compliments
and discussed the topics of the day. These all turn
upon the payment of the new government taxes; and the
price of wheat this year has been so low that the unhappy
peasantry are driven to their wits' end, and finally to usurious
money-lenders, to obtain the necessary cash. In this
emergency I am appealed to in every direction for assistance,
and I was well aware that our interview on this occasion
would not terminate without the usual demand.
</p>

<p>
When it came, I saw my chance for alluding to the delicate
subject of the murder, and the objections I entertained
to lending money to people who were in the habit of murdering
their neighbours. They admitted the murder, which
had been attended with robbery, but my host denied that
he had been in any way implicated, though he had unjustly
suffered several months' imprisonment on suspicion, and had
only been finally released on payment of a heavy sum as
backsheesh. It seems that the evidence as to who the culprit
really was rested on the dying deposition of the victim,
who had been attacked by four men, all of whom he named
on his deathbed. On the other hand, my host had succeeded
<span class="pageno target" title="194" id="page-194"></span>
in proving an alibi. The real culprit had, he said, escaped,
and had never ventured back to the village.
</p>

<p>
Under these circumstances I refused any loan of money,
unless the notables of the village would come to Dalieh,
tender their humble apologies, offer a money indemnity to
the mother of the murdered man, and effect a complete
reconciliation. This, according to Arab custom, is a solemn
ceremony, which must be performed in the presence of the
notables of neighbouring villages; but it yet remained to
be seen whether the indemnity question could be arranged
at Dalieh, as the man who said he had been unjustly accused
declared that he had already suffered so much, in
person and in purse, that he was indisposed to do much in
that line. The poor widow, in spite of her destitution, was
still more intractable; she thirsted for vengeance, for which
she said no money could compensate. However, I have
hopes of bringing them both to reason, and so healing the
feud which extends to all the population of both villages.
Meantime the loan stands in abeyance.
</p>

<p>
There would, indeed, be a good opening for a professional
peacemaker in these villages, where feuds are bitter and
prevalent, not merely between different villages, but between
rival sheiks in the same locality. There are almost
always two, and sometimes three, of these in each village
who are not on speaking terms, and who each have
their partisans, so that the opposing factions keep themselves
entirely aloof from each other. More than once I
have had occasion to call on the same day on two rival
sheiks. In that case one escorts me until he sees his enemy
in the distance. He then takes leave of me, and I stand
still until the other comes up to take me in charge. These
sheiks, I am sorry to say, often combine with the money-lenders
against the interests of their own fellow-villagers.
The mode by which a money-lender obtains possession of a
village is simple; he goes to the sheik, and says: “You and
your village are unable to meet the government demands;
if you will persuade your village to borrow from me at
forty per cent., I will give you so much commission, and if
at the end of three years you can manage irretrievably to
ruin your villagers, so that I can come down upon them and
<span class="pageno target" title="195" id="page-195"></span>
obtain possession of the village in satisfaction of my debt
for half its value, your profit shall be so much, and you
shall retain such a share of the village lands.” As the
sheiks wield an unbounded influence over their own faction,
this would be an easy operation were it not for the
rival sheik, who is in negotiation with a rival money-lender.
When two money-lenders take to fighting over
a village there is some chance for the villagers, and from
this point of view the feuds of their sheiks are not an unmixed
evil.
</p>

<p>
Where a sheik is supreme, as at Dalieh, he has practically
the fortunes of the villagers in his hands, and he must be
watched to see that he uses his influence and authority justly.
The only man in a position to watch him is the person
upon whom he depends for assistance to meet the government
demands. If this individual happens to be content
with a moderate rate of interest, and to have no ulterior designs
upon the village itself, it is evident that he may have
it in his power to do a great deal of good. The villagers
are quite astonished if one comes to them and says, “I do
not want your village, I only want your good-will. I desire
to help you out of your financial scrape, and I am willing to
lend you money at the legal rate of interest if you will furnish
me with the necessary security.” Any one saying this
finds at once that he has arrayed against him the money-lenders,
who take three times the legal rate of interest; the
government officials, who go shares with the money-lenders;
and, in many instances, the village sheiks themselves, who,
of course, find their interest lies rather with these two
classes than with the unhappy villagers. These latter, accustomed
to be plundered all around, naturally do not know
whom to trust, and are apt to look with suspicion on a new
proposal, however favourable and disinterested it may seem.
The obstacles, therefore, to the working-out of improved
conditions by any single man, even in the case of one village,
seem almost insuperable, and can only be overcome
by much personal intercourse with the villagers themselves.
</p>

<p>
The Druses are sensitive to kindness, and grateful for it,
and as there are generally some sick in the village, and
<span class="pageno target" title="196" id="page-196"></span>
quack doctoring, provided one treads cautiously, is better
than none, we do a good deal of empirical practice, and our
efforts have met with such success that we are obtaining a
somewhat alarming reputation. Of course, we come across
difficult cases, as, for instance, the sheik's daughter. She is
rather a nice-looking girl of eighteen, with a crick in her
neck and an asthmatic affection. On asking how long she
had been ill, we were informed that her mother, on the occasion
of her birth, was so angry at finding the child was a
girl and not a boy, that she threw her out of the window,
and she had never been well since. Cases of this sort we
don't attempt to grapple with, but I have ceased to wonder
at the sheik having taken a dislike to the old lady. Indeed,
my own feelings towards her have entirely changed since
hearing of this episode, and, although it happened eighteen
years ago, I treat her with comparative coolness.
</p>

<p>
Why the sheik hesitates so long about divorcing her I
fail to understand, more especially as he is anxious to marry
a young and handsome girl. I have discovered, by the
way, that divorced people are never allowed to meet again,
even in the street, after the separation has finally taken
place. I saw a young friend of mine, in a fit of passion, divorce
his wife last year. She was young and pretty. He
married again, but has already repented, and wants to divorce
his present and remarry his first wife, whom he has
never seen since; but Druse law is inexorable on this point.
There was a meeting of elders on the subject, but they decided
that it was impossible. So now, when this rash
young man sees the former partner of his life at the other
end of the street, he is obliged hurriedly to turn around and
walk the other way, with a sadly beating heart and repentant
spirit.
</p>

<p>
Some weeks ago we opened a boys' school at Dalieh,
where English and Arabic were taught. In a few days we
had an average attendance of over fifty children, while we
received applications from more than twenty girls, which
we were making arrangements to satisfy, as the desire
which the parents manifested to have their children educated
was so strong that we felt it should be encouraged
in every possible way. One day, however, a summons arrived
<span class="pageno target" title="197" id="page-197"></span>
for the sheik to appear before the authorities, when he
was informed that a fine of $250 would be levied on every
child who ventured to go to school; a threat which, to my
great regret, most effectually extinguished that humble institution.

<a href="#toc-38">THE ARISTOCRACY OF MOUNT CARMEL.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Daliet-el-Carmel</span>, Oct. 30.—I have been making acquaintance
with some of my neighbours, and will take you
with me to call upon what in England would be called the
leading members of the county aristocracy. They are the
blue blood of this region of country, the families which in
the early part of the present century exercised power of life
and death, and supreme control, over the inhabitants for many
miles around; who thought nothing of calling out their retainers
and resisting the constituted authority, whether it
was that exercised by the various pachas of Acre, who,
though nominally Turkish governors, were themselves
quasi-independent, or the more iron rule of the Egyptian
conqueror, Ibrahim Pacha, to which, however, they were
eventually forced to succumb.
</p>

<p>
One of these families lives at a village about two hours'
ride from here. In response to a letter couched in the most
flowery Oriental hyperbole, in which my rank is exalted, my
virtues are exaggerated, and the beneficent warmth which
my presence is supposed to radiate is dwelt upon, I determine
to shed it upon the writer of the letter; in other words, to pay
him a visit in the gardens to which he has invited me. Our
way lies down a wild, romantic gorge which leads to a valley
situated among the lower spurs of Carmel, beyond the confines
of the mountain proper, where the country is broken
up by volcanic action into chasms and precipices, well
adapted for defensive purposes, and admirably calculated to
be the stronghold of a not over-scrupulous tribal chief. The
village itself is situated upon a high conical mound, rising
some three hundred feet above the plain; and towering above
the surrounding houses is the high, two-storied, half-castellated
mansion. It is not thither that I am at present bound,
but to a narrow valley about a mile distant from it, which is
<span class="pageno target" title="199" id="page-199"></span>
wedged in between frowning precipices, and is a bright green
strip, in delightful contrast to the gray, overhanging crags,
for it is a dense mass of orange, lemon, fig, pomegranate,
olive, quince, and other fruit-trees, the result of a crystal
fountain which gushes from the rock and fertilizes this fairy-like
scene.
</p>

<p>
These are the summer gardens of my host, and from them,
as he sees me approach, he issues, with several of his retainers,
and leads me to an arbour of overhanging trees, whose
dense foliage forms an impenetrable shade against the noonday
sun. Here carpets have been spread, cushions arranged,
narghiles and coffee have been prepared, and the circle is
formed and the compliments interchanged which are the invariable
prelude to an Eastern entertainment. Soon appear,
on prancing horses, a picturesque group of men in white
flowing <i>abbayes</i>, or transparent summer robes, which flutter
gracefully in the wind. They are richly embroidered, and the
horses are gayly comparisoned; these are the brothers, nephews,
and other members of my host's family. One of them
is a holy man, who has studied theology in the celebrated
seat of Moslem learning, the College of El-Ahzar, in Cairo,
and he is much respected and looked up to in consequence.
</p>

<p>
Knowing that I cannot introduce a more grateful topic,
and anxious to stave off as long as possible the financial one,
which I suspect is in the background, I ask the dignified
group of narghile smokers by which I am surrounded to tell
me something of their family history. About four hundred
years ago, they say, their ancestors came from the Hedjaz,
being a branch of the tribe of Beni Ab Arabs, whose home
were the deserts near Mecca, and who were closely related
to the family of Mohammed. It is this ancestral connection
with the Prophet which has always given the family the
great prestige and consideration which it has enjoyed. In
those days they came into the country as conquerors, and,
settling themselves in their present village, soon reduced the
surrounding district to subjection, and continued to rule it,
nominally subject to the Pacha of Acre, but really independently,
until the invasion of Palestine by Ibrahim Pacha,
when, after a sturdy resistance, they were overcome, and the
grandfather of my host was executed and the greater part of
<span class="pageno target" title="200" id="page-200"></span>
their lands taken from them. From that time the fortunes
of the family began to decline. On the restoration of the
country to the sultan, by means of the intervention of England,
they derived no benefit. The Turkish government
took care not to re-establish an influence which in former
times had proved so formidable, and, indeed, one of my hosts
had spent two years in prison. Some say it was because he
had manifested a spirit of too great independence, but others
allege that it was for the more prosaic reason of an inability
or refusal to pay his debts.
</p>

<p>
At all events, when the money-lending question came up,
not then, but on the occasion of a return visit which they
afterwards paid me, I was assured by those who ought to
know that my picturesque, hospitable, dignified, and aristocratic
hosts were—well, I won't exactly repeat what it was
said they were, but they were not just the kind of people
that one would select to lend money to. This grieved me
exceedingly, not because I wanted to lend them any, but because
they were such gentlemen; in fact, I have been there
since, and been very royally entertained in the old castle—where
the guests' room is gorgeously furnished, for this part
of the world—in order to make my peace for not lending them
money; for it is considered an insult, after you have been a
man's guest and he asks you to accommodate him financially,
if you refuse—which is perplexing when he has no satisfactory
security to offer. Now, I want to keep on good terms
with this powerful and fascinating and somewhat scampish
family without losing my money to them, and the problem
I am engaged in solving is how to do it. I have a horrible
suspicion that it will yet be solved rather to their satisfaction
than to mine.
</p>

<p>
Under these circumstances, paying aristocratic visits does
not seem likely to be an altogether profitable occupation;
but they are not always attended with embarrassments of
this nature. I have other aristocratic friends, who live about
five hours distant from here. They are also originally from
the Hedjaz; they also claim kinship with the Prophet, and
they also once ruled a large tract of country. In fact, the
two families divided the whole of this country between them,
and their history has been almost identical.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="201" id="page-201"></span>
</div>

<p>
My visit to this family was in some respects highly characteristic.
My way led across the Ruhah, or “Breezy-land,”
across open, rolling downs, fairly watered, and covered with
the remains of what was once a magnificent oak forest. The
trees are now dotted singly over it, in park-like fashion.
The village itself was beautifully situated at an elevation
of about seven hundred feet above the sea, on the side
of a thickly wooded mountain, twelve hundred feet high.
On this occasion my host, who came out to meet me, led me
to an elevated platform in front of the village mosque, an
unusually imposing edifice. Here, under the shade of a
spreading mulberry-tree, were collected seven brothers, who
represented the family, and about fifty other members of it.
They were in the act of prayer when I arrived—indeed, they
are renowned for their piety. Along the front of the terrace
was a row of water-bottles for ablutions, behind them
mats on which the praying was going forward, and behind
the worshippers a confused mass of slippers. When they
had done praying, they all got into their slippers. It was a
marvel to me how each knew his own.
</p>

<p>
They led me to what I supposed was a place of honour,
where soft coverlets had been spread near the door of the
mosque. We formed the usual squatting circle, and were
sipping coffee, when suddenly every one started to his feet;
a dark, active little man seemed to dart into the midst of us.
Everybody struggled frantically to kiss his hand, and he
passed through us like a flash to the other end of the platform,
followed by a tall negro, whose hand everybody, including
my aristocratic host, seemed also anxious to kiss. I
had not recovered from my astonishment at this proceeding,
when I received a message from the new-comer to take a
place by his side. I now found that he was on the seat of
honour, and it became a question, until I knew who he was,
whether I should admit his right to invite me to it, thus
acknowledging his superiority in rank—etiquette in these
matters being a point which has to be attended to in the
East, however absurd it may seem among ourselves. I therefore
for the moment ignored his invitation, and asked my
host, in an off-hand way, who he was. He informed me that
he was a mollah, held in the highest consideration for his
<span class="pageno target" title="202" id="page-202"></span>
learning and piety all through the country, upon which he,
in fact, levied a sort of religious tax; that he was here on a
visit, and that in his own home he was in the habit of entertaining
two hundred guests a night, no one being refused
hospitality. His father was a dervish, celebrated for his
miraculous powers, and the mantle thereof had fallen upon
the negro, who had been his servant, and who also was much
venerated, because it was his habit to go to sleep in the
mosque, and be spirited away, no one knew whither, in the
night; in fact, he could become invisible almost at will.
</p>

<p>
Under these circumstances, and seeing that I should seriously
embarrass my host if I stood any longer on my dignity,
I determined to waive it, and joined the saint. He received
me with supercilious condescension, and we exchanged
compliments till dinner was announced, when my host asked
whether I wished to dine alone or with the world at large.
As the saint had been too patronizing to be strictly polite, I
thought I would assert my right to be exclusive, and said I
would dine alone, on which he, with a polite sneer, remarked
that it would be better so, as he had an objection to eating
with any one who drank wine, to which I retorted that I had
an equal objection to dining with those who ate with their
fingers. From this it will appear that my relations with the
holy man were getting somewhat strained.
</p>

<p>
I was, therefore, supplied with a pyramid of rice and six
or seven elaborately cooked dishes all to myself, and squatted
on one mat, while a few yards off the saint, my host, and all
his brothers squatted on another. When they had finished
their repast their places were occupied by others, and I
counted altogether more than fifty persons feeding on the
mosque terrace at my host's expense. Dinner over, they all
trooped in to pray, and I listened to the monotonous chanting
of the Koran till it was time to go to bed. My host offered
me a mat in the mosque, where I should have a chance of
seeing the miraculous disappearance of the negro; but as I
had no faith in this, and a great deal in the snoring by which
I should be disturbed, I slept in a room apart, as exclusively
as I had dined.
</p>

<p>
I was surprised next morning to observe a total change in
the saint's demeanour. All the supercilious pride of the
<span class="pageno target" title="203" id="page-203"></span>
previous evening had vanished, and we soon became most
amiable to each other. That he was a fanatic hater of the
Giaour I felt no doubt, but for some reason he had deemed
it politic to adopt an entirely altered demeanour. It was another
illustration of the somewhat painful lesson which one
has to learn in one's intercourse with Orientals. They must
never be allowed to outswagger you.

<a href="#toc-39">THE JORDAN VALLEY CANAL.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, Nov. 10.—In one of my former letters I described
the nature of the concession which had been obtained by
some capitalists at Beyrout for the construction of a railway
from Haifa to Damascus, and of the survey of the line,
which had already been completed half-way to the latter
city. The matter has been the subject of a good deal of
financial intrigue, and the capital which was sought for in
London has not been forthcoming in consequence. A new
element of uncertainty has just been imported into the project
by the agitation created by the proposal to connect the
Red Sea with the Mediterranean by means of a ship canal,
which, commencing at Haifa, should be cut through the
plain of Esdraelon to the valley of the Jordan, letting the
waters of the Mediterranean into the Ghor, as that valley
is called, and connecting the lower end of the Dead Sea
with the Red Sea by a canal which should debouch at
Akaba.
</p>

<p>
This project originated principally among British shipowners
and capitalists, who have hoped in this way to destroy
the monopoly which M. de Lesseps claims to possess
of water communication between the Mediterranean and the
Red Sea across the Isthmus of Suez. As the proposed
canal does not touch the isthmus, the French company
would have no ground of complaint. As, however, great
uncertainty still exists as to the practicability of the scheme,
a sum of £10,000 has been subscribed by the promoters of
the proposed company to make the preliminary surveys, and
to obtain the necessary permission from the sultan to do so.
According to the first accounts, his majesty set his face
against any survey of the kind proposed, but the latest advices
would go to show that he has changed his mind, and
it would seem not only that the requisite permission has
<span class="pageno target" title="205" id="page-205"></span>
been granted, but that the surveying party are actually on
their way to Port Said.
</p>

<p>
It will now be interesting to consider, by the light of our
present information, what are the chances of success, what
is the nature of the obstacles the scheme will have to encounter,
and how it proposes to overcome them, so far as
they are known. In the first place, it does not follow, because
the sultan has granted permission for the survey, that
he will afterwards, supposing it to be found practicable,
grant a firman for the accomplishment of the work. The
advantages he will derive from it are: Easy access to his
dominions in Arabia, which extend as far south as Aden;
an enormous sum of money, which will be paid to him in
compensation for about fifteen hundred square miles of land
submerged, chiefly government property, and a large annual
income to be derived from tolls on the canal, and the development
of extensive tracts of fertile country, especially
to the east of the Jordan, which are now inaccessible and
unproductive. That such a canal would add immensely to
the resources of the empire, and be a source of great profit,
there can be no doubt. On the other hand, it would almost
amount to the virtual annexation of Palestine by England,
whose influence in that country, backed by the enormous
expenditure of capital which would be involved, would be
supreme. It is a question, therefore, whether the sultan
would consider that the pecuniary advantage which he
would gain would be compensated by the political sacrifice
which would have to be incurred.
</p>

<p>
In regard to the engineering difficulties, so far as they
are known, the only records of levels which we have of the
elevation of the land between the Red Sea and the Dead
Sea are those made at different times by three Frenchmen—Mons.
Lartet, Mons. Vigne, and Mons. Luynes. These
only differ nineteen feet—the lowest being seven hundred
and eighty-one feet, the highest eight hundred; but it must
be remembered that these are not the result of actual survey,
but of rough estimates, and there may be depressions
in the dividing ridge which may have escaped these gentlemen's
observation.<a id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor"><sup>[2]</sup></a> The dividing ridge is said to be calcareous
<span class="pageno target" title="206" id="page-206"></span>
rock—the summit level distant fifty-two miles from
the Red Sea and fifty-eight from the Dead Sea, which is
nearly thirteen hundred feet lower than the level of the
ocean—and it is assumed that the engineering work would
be facilitated by the scour which would be caused by the
sea rushing down such a steep incline in a distance of one
hundred miles. It is not, however, proposed to let the full
force of the ocean in from this end. The operation of
flooding the Jordan valley would be commenced at Haifa;
from this point to the sea-level in the Ghor is only twenty-five
miles. The highest point in the plain of Esdraelon is
one hundred and fifty-seven feet above the sea. Through
this it is proposed to cut a canal two hundred feet wide and
forty feet deep. The volume of water thus let in, it is calculated,
would be regulated to an inflow which would equal
about twenty Jordans, and, allowing for evaporation, it is
estimated that in five years the Dead Sea and the whole
valley of the Jordan would be submerged to the sea-level.
</p>

<p>
The effect of this submergence would be, of course, to
bury the Dead Sea under twelve hundred feet of ocean, and
to create an inland sea about ninety miles long and from
four to six wide. Jericho, Beisan (the ancient Bethshean),
and Tiberias would be the principal places submerged, besides
a few small villages. With the exception of Tiberias,
none of these are, however, of any importance. Tiberias
contains a population of over three thousand, chiefly Jews,
and a Latin and Greek monastery. Apart from the question
of compensating this population, and paying for the
fertile lands which they occupy, a very important political
question enters into consideration. The French have been
the protectors of the Latin monastery at Tiberias from
time immemorial, and the Russians occupy the same position
with regard to the Greek monastery. Are these two
powers, whose interests would be in different ways vitally
affected by the success of the scheme, likely to be induced
to consent to it by any proposal of pecuniary indemnification?
Its success would utterly ruin the Suez Canal and
almost extinguish French influence in Syria, while Russia,
<span class="pageno target" title="207" id="page-207"></span>
which now aims at the annexation of Palestine and the occupation
of Jerusalem, where her influence is at this moment
greater than that of any other European nation, would find
herself practically cut off from it by an inland sea, the private
property of her traditional enemy. In both countries
the governments could appeal to the religious sentiment of
the people to support them in resisting, even to a war if
necessary, the flooding of the holy places at Tiberias which
they have guarded for so many centuries.
</p>

<p>
Nor would this sentimental feeling be confined to France
and Russia. Even in England and America there would be
a strong objection to the Lake of Tiberias, with the historic
sites of Capernaum and the other cities on its margin, which
were the scenes of some of the most remarkable ministrations
of our Lord, being buried five hundred feet deep beneath
the sea. Curiously enough, the project is no less
keenly supported by one set of religionists than it is condemned
by the other. The former pin their faith to the
prophecy contained in the forty-seventh chapter of Ezekiel,
eighth to tenth verses, where it is predicted that “fishers
shall stand upon the sea from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim,”
but even this would not be the case if the scheme were carried
out, for then En-gedi would be several hundred feet
below the surface of the sea.
</p>

<p>
The sanguine supporters of the scheme maintain that it
can be accomplished for eight millions sterling, while its opponents
have entered upon an elaborate calculation to prove
that the lowest figure is £225,573,648 and some odd shillings.
Supposing, as seems not impossible, that the one set prove
too little, and the other too much, if it could be done for
fifty millions sterling it would pay a fair interest. The
last year's receipts of the Suez Canal, which cost twenty
millions, were £4,800,000. The whole length of the canal
would be two hundred and fifty miles, of which, however,
only about one hundred and twenty would be actual cutting,
but cutting of a nature unparalleled in the history of engineering.
My own impression is that, both from a political
and an engineering point of view, it will be found to be
impracticable; but who can say in these days what science
may not accomplish or what combinations of the Eastern
question may not arise to remove political difficulties?
</p>

<div class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_2"></a>
<p class="foot"><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
Since the above was written the dividing range has been carefully surveyed, and the lowest part found to be between six and seven hundred feet
above the level of the Red Sea.

<a href="#toc-40">LOCAL POLITICS AND PROGRESS.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, Nov. 27.—The native population here is in a high
state of excitement at news which has just reached us. The
government, it is reported, intends transferring the seat of
the provincial government from Acre to this place. This
change has been recommended on the grounds of the superior
excellence of the harbour of Haifa, of its increasing export
trade and rapidly growing population, and, above all, of the
constantly augmenting influence of foreigners, which is the
natural result of the inflow of their capital and of their industry
and enterprise.
</p>

<p>
The old fortress of Acre, at present the residence of the
governor, or mutessarif, contains a population of about nine
thousand, pent up within the walls of the fort and crowded
into an area of little more than fifty acres. They are for
the most part fanatic Moslems, which means a state of stagnation
in industry and commercial pursuits; and in consequence
of the military rule which prohibits any extension of
the town outside of the walls of the fortress within range of
the guns, no expansion is possible to the inhabitants. The
population of Haifa, on the other hand, is increasing with
great rapidity, and the place seems to resound from one end
to the other with the clink of the stone-mason's chisel, as
new houses spring up in all directions. These considerations
would not alone, however, account for the resolution at which
the government seems to have arrived.
</p>

<p>
Three fourths of the population of Haifa are either Roman
or Greek Catholics; in other words, they are under the protection
of the French Consul when religious questions are
concerned; and the policy of the French government in Syria
has been to extend its religious protectorate into political and
secular matters, to a degree which is constantly giving rise to
awkward questions and complications not devoid of danger.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="209" id="page-209"></span>
</div>

<p>
A great part of the house property in the town of Haifa
is owned by the monks of Mount Carmel, who consider the
whole of Carmel, from the monastery at the western extremity
of the mountain, to their chapel at the Place of Elijah's
Sacrifice at the other end, as a sort of private preserve,
and push their religious pretensions to such an extreme that
they look with the utmost jealousy upon any foreigner who
attempts to buy land in the mountain, and oppose any such
proceeding with all their energy.
</p>

<p>
The policy of the Turkish government, on the other hand,
is to prevent any foreigners buying land there, or, indeed,
anywhere else in Palestine, although they are entitled to do
so by treaty; and in pursuit of this policy the local authorities
are instructed to throw every obstacle in the way of
foreign enterprise of all descriptions, but especially to render
it impossible for persons not subjects of Turkey to acquire
landed property. They have, on these grounds, used their
utmost endeavors to ruin the Jewish colony of Zimmarin,
which is also in the neighborhood of Haifa, by prohibiting
the colonists from building houses for themselves, on the
ground that they have no right to the land. They have
based this claim on the allegation that the proprietor of the
property, who was an Austrian Jew, in whose name it was
bought for the colonists, died childless, and, according to
Turkish law, landed property reverts to the Turkish government
under these circumstances; and the government therefore
claimed the property. It so happened, however, that
the owner did not die childless. Indeed, I know his son myself,
but the government refused to admit the evidence of
any but Moslems as to whether he had a son or not, a demand
which, as the deceased proprietor did not live in Turkey,
it was naturally impossible to comply with. The question
has therefore been pending between Baron Rothschild,
who took over the property on the death of its nominal
proprietor, and the Turkish government for nearly two years;
but I understand that permission has at last been obtained
for the erection of houses by the colonists, and the affair
has been arranged.
</p>

<p>
The fact, however, that foreign questions are constantly
arising at Haifa, either out of French pretensions or the
<span class="pageno target" title="210" id="page-210"></span>
claims of the German or Jewish colonists, and that no such
questions are possible at Acre, where there is but a limited
Christian or foreign population, has rendered it desirable in
the eyes of the Governor-general of Syria to suggest the
removal of the governor of the district to this place. The
change has not yet been sanctioned at Constantinople, and
the inhabitants of Acre, where property will suffer an immediate
depreciation, have been pouring petitions into Constantinople
to protest against the change, urging as a reason
that they, who were loyal and devoted subjects of his majesty,
will suffer; while the population of Haifa, composed
principally of Christians and foreigners, will benefit. It is
just possible, however, that the government may consider
that the loyalty and devotion of the petitioners form the
best reasons why the governor should be moved to a place
where the loyalty and devotion of the people are not so
assured, and should therefore be watched. At all events,
there can be no doubt that the change, should it take place,
will cause an immediate rise in the value of property here,
and that there will be a considerable influx of people from
Acre to this town, which has the advantage in summer of
being a much cooler and more agreeable place of residence.
</p>

<p>
Meantime, advantage has been taken of this opportunity
to remove the present governor and replace him by a more
intelligent and active functionary, a change which has caused
great satisfaction, both to Moslems and Christians, as, in
spite of his fanaticism, he had contrived to make himself
very unpopular with the former, while he altogether failed
to keep the peace at Acre between the rival sects of the latter,
who, though very limited in number, were constantly
engaged in broils. Moreover, it is not the habit of the
Turkish government to retain its functionaries, under any
circumstances, long at the same post.
</p>

<p>
The only drawback to Haifa as the new seat of government
is its limited water supply. At present the town depends
entirely upon its wells, and although an abundance of
water can be found at a trifling depth, it is usually a little
too brackish to be altogether palatable. Under these
<span id="circumstances">circumstances</span>
it became of the utmost importance, in view of the
proposed change, to try and find a spring, sufficiently copious
<span class="pageno target" title="211" id="page-211"></span>
and near the town to be utilized, and it occurred to a
friend and myself that such a one might exist at Rushmea,
where are the ruins of an old Crusading fort, which I have
described in a former letter, distant about an hour's ride
from the town, at an elevation of about seven hundred feet
above the level of the sea. There is a well here called the
Well of Elias, into which I once descended, and found that
it was supplied with water which entered through a tunnel
in the rock, but had no outlet; and the shepherds told me
that, however much they watered their flocks, the water
always remained at the same height, while in winter, although
the well was eight feet deep, the water rose in it so high as
to overflow the mouth. Under these circumstances it was
evident that the well was, in fact, a sort of back-water of
some underground stream or rivulet, which found a subterranean
channel for itself. This we determined, by excavation,
to try and discover.
</p>

<p>
We therefore commenced digging near the well, and about
two feet from the surface struck the roof of a subterranean
aqueduct. Uncovering this, we found that the channel had
become silted up with mud, which required to be removed.
We then found that we were in an arched tunnel, the sides
of which were roughly built with stone, while the floor was
paved with the same material, in which a channel had been
cut, but it was four inches higher than the water in the well.
We were therefore obliged to take it up, cutting, altogether,
a trench thirty yards long and eight feet deep. On drawing
the water off by means of this channel, we uncovered the
mouth of the tunnel, by which it entered, sufficiently to send
in a man with a light. After wading through the mud for
a few paces, he came upon a vault beautifully cemented,
thus proving that in ancient times the stream had been
utilized. It would have involved a greater expense, however,
to clear out than I was prepared to incur, unaided by
the community for whose benefit it would have inured. As
it was, the stream thus discovered was almost sufficient in
volume to be worth conveying to Haifa, a distance of three
miles, and could doubtless be much increased. In the course
of our excavations we came upon several large blocks of
square stone, which had formed part of the ancient tunnel.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="212" id="page-212"></span>
</div>

<p>
The project of the railway from Haifa to Damascus, the
concession for which had lapsed in consequence of the combined
greed and apathy of the first grantees, is now revived
under more favorable auspices, and I have little doubt that
the change of the seat of the government to this place will
give it a renewed impetus, so that before long it will be carried
out.
</p>

<p>
Meantime, unwonted energy is displayed by the government
in improving our communications. Having occasion
a few weeks ago to ride to Beyrout, I saw the surveyors at
work tracing out a line for a carriage road to connect that
important city with Haifa. The distance is about eighty
miles, and there are no serious engineering difficulties in the
way. This road is sadly needed, especially now, when, owing
to the cholera in Europe, no steamer touches here on its way
to Beyrout, although we are visited once a fortnight by one
coming from that place after it has performed there a quarantine
of five days. The habit, unfortunately, of the government
of making the road, and postponing to an indefinite
period the construction of the bridges, goes far to neutralize
its good intentions. The towns through which the road
passes are heavily taxed, and then, owing to the want of
bridges, it is useless for a great part of the year. Should
this road be completed, Beyrout, Damascus, Jaffa, Jerusalem,
Nazareth, Haifa, Tyre, and Sidon will all be connected by
roads over which stages could run; and this would go far to
facilitate travel in Palestine, and enable tourists to dispense
with that system of tenting which now renders it so slow
and expensive.

<h3 id="letter-41">
<a href="#toc-41">THE IDENTIFICATION OF ANCIENT SITES.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, Dec. 13.—The researches which I have been making
into the oldest authorities, with the view of identifying
the sites of the numerous ancient towns that once formed
the homes of the extensive population which in ages long
gone by inhabited this coast, have only served to reveal to
me the enormous difficulty of the task. This difficulty is
created partly by the confusion introduced by the crusading
nomenclature and traditions, partly by the inaccuracy of the
itineraries of early pilgrims and travellers, and to the discrepancies
existing in the most primitive maps, and the contradictions
in historical records. Thus between this place
and Tantura, a distance of fifteen miles, I have visited the
ruins of no fewer than nine ancient towns or villages, some
of them of considerable size, not one of which, with the exception
of Tantura, which is the Biblical Dor, has been positively
identified. I do not include in these the ruins of
towns a mile or more inland, which would double the number
and convey some idea of the denseness of the population
which once inhabited this section of the country.
At the same time it is possible, from the varied character
of these ruins, that some were far more ancient than the
others, and that they may have existed as traces of a still
more early people, when other cities, also now in ruin, were
rich and flourishing. Thus we have on this coast remains of
the early Phœenician period, of the Greek period, of the Roman
or Byzantine period, and, lastly, of the crusading period—the
latter too modern to be of any archæological interest.
They consist merely of constructions built from the materials
of the civilizations which had preceded it. Not content
with using up these materials, the crusaders gave the
towns and forts which they built wrong names, refusing to
adopt the Saracen nomenclature, which was generally a corruption
of the original Canaanitish or Hebrew, and attempting
<span class="pageno target" title="214" id="page-214"></span>
to identify them according to their own ideas of Biblical
topography, or reading of Roman history, thereby introducing
inextricable confusion. Thus we have William of
Tyre, one of the crusading historiographers, gravely informing
us that “Duke Godfrey de Bouillon awarded, with his
usual magnanimity, to the generous and noble Tancred the
city of Tiberias, on the Lake of Genasereth, as well as of
the whole of Galilee and the sea-town of Kaypha (or Haifa),
which is otherwise called Porphyria.”
</p>

<p>
The Carmelite monks still cling to this tradition, although
modern research has proved beyond a doubt that the site,
at all events of one Roman city of Porphyrion, was at
Khan-Yunis, a ruin, eight miles north of Sidon, and at least
seventy miles from Haifa. To escape this difficulty some
have supposed there were two Porphyrions, and that one
was here, basing their argument on the fact that in the Onomasticon
of Eusebius and Jerome there is a city marked at
the point of Carmel, called Chilzon, and that Chilzon is the
Hebrew for the murex, or shellfish which produced the purple
dye found there in great quantities; hence Porphyrion,
or the purple city.
</p>

<p>
In carefully examining these ruins, and remarking the
great quantity of carved porphyry which is peculiar to them,
I have thought it furnished a stronger argument in favor of
what would seem an appropriate appellation. The crusaders
even confounded the Sea of Galilee with the Mediterranean;
thus they supposed a connection to exist between the town
of Caiapha, or Caiaphas (the modern Haifa), which Benjamin
of Tudela asserts to have been founded by Caiaphas, the
high-priest, and Cephas, the Greek name of Simon Peter.
Hence near Haifa the crusading clergy showed the rock
where Simon Peter fished, called to this day Tell el-Samak,
or the Mound of the Fish. Laboring under a similar confusion
of idea, they built a fort out of the ruins of a place
called at the present day Kefr Lam, a name which, no doubt,
dates back before the times of the crusaders, and which they
twisted into Capernaum, that place being, as we all know,
on the Sea of Galilee. The Capernaum of the crusaders,
however, is a village on the Mediterranean shore, thirteen
miles down the coast from here.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="215" id="page-215"></span>
</div>

<p>
The itineraries of the pilgrims and early travellers are
scarcely less perplexing. They are generally careful to record
the distances between the various places they visit, but
rarely with accuracy. Their remarks, however, are naïve
and amusing. I have just been reading the journal of a
certain Antoninus, the Martyr, who travelled in Palestine
about the year <span class="sc small">A.D.</span> 530. Writing of Tyre, he says:
</p>

<p class="block-quote">
“The city of Tyre contains influential men; the life there is very wicked;
the luxury such as cannot be described. There are public brothels, and silk
and other kinds of clothing are woven.”
</p>

<p>
We do not altogether see the connection in this last sentence.
Going on, he remarks:
</p>

<p class="block-quote">
“Thence we came to Ptolemais (the modern Acre), a respectable city,
where we found good monasteries. Opposite Ptolemais, six miles off, is a
city which is named Sycaminus, under Mount Carmel. A mile from Sycaminus
are the hamlets of the Samaritans, and above the hamlets, a mile and a
half away, is the Monastery of Heliseus (or Elijah), the prophet, at the place
where the woman met him whose child he raised from the dead. On Mount
Carmel is found a stone, of small size and round, which, when struck, rings
because it is solid. This is the virtue of the stone—if it be hung on to a
woman, or to any animal, they will never miscarry. About six or seven miles
off is the city of Porphyrion.”
</p>

<p>
Now there are as many mistakes as there are sentences in
this quaint account by the holy man. It is a matter of dispute
which are the ruins of Sycaminus. Two ruins claim
that honor, and one of these it undoubtedly is. They are
only two miles apart, but the nearest is thirteen miles from
Acre, instead of six, and the other fifteen. A mile from
Sycaminus, he says, are the hamlets of the Samaritans. These
have been identified beyond all doubt as a ruin called Kefr
es Samir, two miles and a half beyond one of the abovementioned
ruins, and four miles and a half beyond the other.
The Monastery of Heliseus, the prophet, “a mile and
a half away,” I have described in a former letter. It is the
picturesque gorge and ruin called Ain Siah, but the place
where Elijah met the woman of Sarepta was, if we are to
believe the Bible, “at the gate of that city,” at least fifty
miles distant from Carmel. There is no doubt as to its site,
between Tyre and Sidon. As to “the stone of small size,
which, when struck, rings because it is solid,” it happens to
<span class="pageno target" title="216" id="page-216"></span>
ring because it is hollow. I have an interesting collection
of these geodes, found near Ain Siah, their peculiar shapes
having given rise to the legend that they were melons and
other fruits which the proprietor refused the prophet when
he was hungry, and which the latter therefore blasted with
petrifaction. And then comes the final statement about
the unhappy Porphyrion, which he puts six miles off, thus
probably identifying it with Athlit, and making confusion
worse confounded. First we have the Jerusalem Itinerary,
distinctly placing it to the north of Sidon, a position confirmed
by other authorities; then we have William of Tyre
identifying it with Haifa, and now we have Antoninus putting
it six miles off.
</p>

<p>
I will not inflict upon you all my reasons for coming to
the conclusion that the ruin at Tell el-Samak, the Mound of
the Fish already alluded to, is the site of Sycaminum, though
I doubt whether a larger population did not inhabit the city
two miles nearer Haifa, where the porphyry fragments
abound. To judge by the fine carvings at both places, they
must have been wealthy as well as populous, and their most
prosperous period was in all probability during the first
three or four centuries of our era. The coins which I have
found so far are of that epoch. Exploring the ruins of
what must have been the upper tower of Sycaminus, distant
about four hundred yards from the Fish Mound, and
two hundred feet above it, a few days ago, I came upon a
cistern with four circular apertures. Upon being let down
into it I found it was seventy feet long, hewn out of the
solid rock, twenty feet broad, and twelve feet high from the
débris at the bottom, but in reality much deeper. The roof
was supported by three columns, four feet square, also hewn
from the living rock. The cement was still in some places
perfect, and the cistern must have been capable of containing
a vast supply of water. It was about fifteen yards from
an angle of a wall composed of rubble, from which the ashlar
had been removed, about four feet thick, and still standing
in places to a height of four feet. In others the foundations
of this wall were easily traceable. As the whole ruin
seems to have escaped the observation of the Palestine Exploration
Survey, I measured it, and found the east wall to
<span class="pageno target" title="217" id="page-217"></span>
be one hundred and twelve yards long, the south wall sixty-five,
the west wall seventy, and an intersecting wall forty.
I could find no traces of a north wall. It was probably a
fortress, which was supplied by the cistern already mentioned.
In the neighborhood were some fine rock-cut tombs,
two with six loculi, each in a good state of preservation. I
also picked up a piece of white marble on which was an inscription
in early Arabic characters, but only the word “Allah”
and two or three more letters remained on the fragment.
</p>

<p>
At Kefr Lam, the crusaders' Capernaum, which I had occasion
recently to visit, I discovered two very remarkable
vaults, each forty feet long by twelve broad and seven high.
The roof was supported by five arches, each arch composed
of a single stone four feet broad, on the top of which huge
flat stones had been laid. I have never seen any constructions
like these vaults, and think they probably dated from
a very ancient period. In the immediate neighborhood the
peasantry had recently opened an ancient well, thirty-five
feet deep, the water being approached by a flight of steps
round two sides of the well, the shaft of which was about
thirty feet square. There were no fewer than seventeen
handsome rock-cut tombs in the neighborhood of the village,
and I regretted that I had not time to prolong my investigations,
as I feel convinced that the vicinity would
repay examination. As it is, I have obtained from the villagers
several good specimens of terra-cotta lamps, two curious
alabaster saucers, some coins, and other antiquities.

<a href="#toc-42">THE SEA OF GALILEE IN THE TIME OF CHRIST.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, Dec. 26.—In reading the works of Dr. Kitto and
other writers who have endeavoured to present a picture of
the manners and customs of the population which inhabited
Palestine in ancient times, I have been much struck by the
erroneous impressions which the descriptions of those writers
are calculated to convey in many important respects.
This has arisen from the fact that while they have portrayed,
with tolerable accuracy, the rude civilization of the original
inhabitants and the subsequent civilization grafted upon it
by their Jewish conquerors, they have left out of consideration
the changes worked upon, and the modifications introduced
into, the social conditions thus produced by that still
higher and later civilization which resulted from Greek and
Roman invasions. Thus while they carefully trace back
the habits of the modern fellahin, and show that they differ
slightly from those of the peasantry of the country in the
time of Christ, and invoke the testimony of modern Bedouins
as evidence of a mode of life which has undergone no
perceptible alteration since the days of Abraham, they leave
out of account altogether that magnificent Roman and Byzantine
civilization, traces of which still exist in such abundance
as to astound the traveller with its splendor and its
richness, but which has passed away like a dream, leaving
nothing behind but the coarse barbarism which has succeeded
it, and which is almost identical in character with
what it supplanted. Hence it is that these writers have
found those resemblances between the modern and ancient
manners and customs of the inhabitants of this country by
which they were so much struck, and which they have given
to the public as furnishing an accurate picture of what ancient
Palestine was like.
</p>

<p>
We are so much in the habit of confining our interest in
<span class="pageno target" title="219" id="page-219"></span>
this country to its history before the time of Christ that it
will probably strike many with surprise to learn that the
most flourishing epoch of its history was subsequent to that
time; that never before had the arts and sciences reached
so high a pitch; that never before had its population been
so wealthy and luxurious, its architecture so grand, its commerce
so flourishing, and its civilization generally so advanced.
It is true it had lost its independence, and was
only a Roman province, but it is just because it was one,
and not a Jewish kingdom, that our impression of its actual
condition at the time of Christ is apt to be so erroneous.
</p>

<p>
This fact has been very forcibly brought to my notice in
a recent trip which I have made along the shores of the Sea
of Galilee, more especially along its little-explored northern
and eastern coasts, where the evidences of the wealth and
luxury of the former inhabitants still remain in unexampled
profusion. In reading in the Gospels the narrative of the
works and life of Christ, so much of which was spent upon
the shores of the lake, in one of the cities of which he for
some time took up his abode, most of us have endeavoured,
probably, to picture him to ourselves amid purely Jewish
surroundings and conditions closely resembling those which
we have been in the habit of associating with that previous
period of Jewish history with which we are familiar in the
books of the Old Testament. So far from that being the
case, the part of the country in which his ministrations were
principally exercised, was beyond all others a centre of Roman
life, with all its luxurious accompaniments. Nowhere
else in Palestine was there such a congeries of rich and
populous cities as were crowded round the shores of this
small lake. Nowhere else could the Jewish reformer come
into closer contact with the rites of a worship alien to his
own.
</p>

<p>
On the shores of this lake might be seen temple after
temple rearing their vast colonnades of graceful columns,
their courts ornamented with faultlessly carved statues to
the deities of a heathen cult. Here were the palaces of
the Roman high functionaries, the tastefully decorated
villas of rich citizens, with semi-tropical gardens irrigated
by the copious streams which have their sources in the
<span class="pageno target" title="220" id="page-220"></span>
plain of Genesareth and the neighbouring hills. Here were
broad avenues and populous thoroughfares, thronged with
the motley concourse which so much wealth and magnificence
had attracted—rich merchants from Antioch, then
the most gorgeous city of the East, and from the Greek
islands, traders and visitors from Damascus, Palmyra, and
the rich cities of the Decapolis; caravans from Egypt and
Persia, Jewish rabbis jostling priests of the worship of the
sun, and Roman soldiers swaggering across the marketplaces,
where the peasantry were exposing the produce of
their fields and gardens for sale, and where fish was displayed
by the hardy toilers of the lake, among whom were
those whom the Great Teacher selected to be the first recipients
of his message and the channels for its communication
to after ages.
</p>

<p>
Thus it was, as I rode along the margin of the sea the
other day, that I was enabled to repeople its shores in imagination
by the light of the remains with which they are still
strewn, and, overtaken in its desolation by the shades of
night, to fancy its now gloomy shores ablaze with the scintillations
proceeding from the lamps of at least a dozen
large cities, and the almost continuous street of habitations
which connected them, and to illuminate its now dark and
silent waters with countless brilliantly-lighted boats, skimming
over its smooth surface, containing noble ladies and
gallants on their way to or from scenes of nocturnal festivity,
or indulging in moonlight picnics, with the accompaniments
of wine and song and music. That life in these cities
was profligate and dissipated in a high degree we may gather
from Christ's denunciation of Bethsaida, Chorazin, and Capernaum,
which he declared to be so much more wicked than
Tyre or Sidon, or even Sodom, that it would be more tolerable
in the day of judgment for those cities than for the
three he was denouncing. That among these Capernaum
was the one of the greatest splendor, and was puffed up
therefore with the pride of its own pomp and magnificence,
we may gather from the indignant apostrophe: “And thou,
Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven.” It may have
been because he considered this city the wickedest, as it appears
to have been the largest on the lake, and therefore
<span class="pageno target" title="221" id="page-221"></span>
the most in need of his ministrations, that he chose it for
some time as his residence. Hence it came to be called
“his own city.” This circumstance invests it with a special
interest in our eyes.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, a violent contest rages between Palestinologists,
if I may be allowed to coin the word, as to the
exact site of Capernaum. The two places which claim this
honor are now called Khan Minieh and Tell Hum respectively.
Until lately the weight of opinion was in favor of
the former site; latterly the researches of Sir Charles Wilson,
on behalf of the Palestine Exploration Fund, have convinced
that accomplished archæologist and careful explorer
that the true site of this celebrated city is to be found at
Tell Hum. It would weary my readers if I were to quote
all the texts relied upon by the disputants to maintain each
hypothesis, supported by calculations of distance, the accounts
of Josephus, and of early pilgrim or Arab travellers.
The subject has been pretty well thrashed out, but I doubt
whether it is even yet exhausted. I incline strongly to the
Tell Hum theory, but as Khan Minieh comes first on our
way as we glide from Tiberias to the head of the lake, as it
is unquestionably the site of what was once a city, and as it
is a highly picturesque spot, and one, moreover, full of Biblical
interest as being, if not Capernaum itself, within three
miles of that city, and therefore a spot which must have
been the scene of some of Christ's labours, will begin by
describing it.
</p>

<p>
The plain of Genesareth, the unrivalled fertility and luxuriance
of which, though it is now uncultivated, I described
in a former letter, when I crossed it eighteen months ago
on my way to Safed, is terminated at its northern extremity
by a mountain range, which projects in a lofty and
precipitous crag into the lake, and renders any passage
round it by land extremely difficult. This projection forms
a little bay, or rather rush-grown lagoon, running back into
the head of the plain. Into it falls a small stream, powerful
enough, however, to turn a mill. It is this building and the
ruins of an ancient khan near it, which was itself constructed
from the remains of an ancient city about three hundred
yards distant, which is now called Khan Minieh. The true
<span class="pageno target" title="222" id="page-222"></span>
site of the old city is not, however, where the khan now
stands, but not far from a fountain, shaded by an old fig-tree,
from which the fountain takes its name—Ain el-Tin,
or the Fountain of the Fig-tree, which suggests the idea
that either the name is very new or the fig-tree very old.
A plentiful supply of water flows from it, slightly brackish,
with a temperature of 82° Fahrenheit. The water is crowded
with fish and surrounded with green turf. It appears to
be one of the seven fountains mentioned by Theodorus,
<span class="sc small">A.D.</span> 530, as being two miles from Magdala, the city of Mary
Magdalene, in the direction of Capernaum.
</p>

<p>
Near this fountain are some old foundations and traces of
ruins, but these for the most part cover a series of mounds
where a few walls are visible, but no traces of columns,
capitals, or handsome blocks of stone, and much smaller in
extent than those of Tell Hum. Indeed, the whole area is
not more than two hundred yards long by one hundred
broad, and this is one reason for supposing that it cannot be
the site of that important city. The khan itself is at least
as old as the twelfth century, being mentioned by Bohaeddin
in his life of Saladin. A road from here leads up the
steep hillside to Safed. The view from it, as we ascend to
some elevation above the plain, is very beautiful. That fertile
expanse which Josephus calls “the ambition of nature,”
lies stretched at our feet, with the waters of the lake rippling
upon its pebbly beach, while we look right up the
gorge of Hammam, its beetling cliffs on both sides towering
in rugged cave-perforated precipices to a height of twelve
hundred feet above the tiny stream which, compressed between
these lofty walls of limestone and basalt, winds its
way to the lake.
</p>

<p>
But it is not up the wild mountain-side that our present
way lies; so, taking our last look at the crumbling walls of
the old khan, at the picturesque water-mill, the ruin-strewn
mounds, and the grassy lagoon, we prepare to skirt the rocky
flank of the ledge which here dips into the waters of the
Sea of Genesareth, and by which we hope to reach the
ruins of Bethsaida.

LOAVES AND TWO SMALL FISHES.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, Jan. 6, 1885.—If, as I stated in my last letter, students
of Biblical topography have been much exercised in
their minds as to the identification of the ruins on the northwest
shore of the Sea of Galilee, which indicate the site of
the once famous city of Capernaum, and have applied not
only a great amount of antiquarian research and of time in
the way of minute local examination and literary labor in
the hope of definitely settling this knotty point, there is another
upon which they have no less anxiously expended their
ingenuity. This is to solve the vexed question as to whether
there were, in the time of Christ, two Bethsaidas or one.
This question would never have arisen but for the confusion
introduced into the scriptural narrative by the puzzling accounts
given in all the four gospels of the miracle of the
feeding of the multitude with five loaves and two fishes, the
scene of which the four evangelists are unanimous in describing
as having been in a desert spot which must have
been on the eastern side of the lake, for immediately afterwards
“they crossed over to the other side,” arriving at
Capernaum, which was on the western side. But according
to one (Luke) this desert place (on the eastern side) belonged
to a city called Bethsaida; and according to another
(Mark) Christ, after the miracle, “constrained his
disciples to get into the ship and go to the other (or western)
side before, unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.”
Hence the confusion; starting from the western side, they
take ship, cross over to a desert place belonging to Bethsaida;
the miracle is performed there, and the disciples are
constrained by their Master to take ship and cross the lake
back again to what must be another Bethsaida. Then the
storm arises, he comes to them on the waters, and they finally
reach Capernaum in safety.

<p>
Reland, the learned geographer of the last century, was
the first to invent the second Bethsaida on the western side,
which is not mentioned by either Josephus or Pliny, the
latter of whom distinctly puts it on the eastern side; and I
have not been able exactly to discover upon what authority
Reland hit upon this easy solution of the problem. The
only historical Bethsaida of which we have any certain record
was a place at the northeastern extremity, originally a
village, but rebuilt and adorned by Philip the Tetrarch, and
raised to the dignity of a town under the name of Julias,
after the daughter of the emperor. Here, in a magnificent
tomb, Philip was himself buried. On the other hand, we
have indications of the existence of another Bethsaida in
the mention of a Bethsaida which was the birthplace of
Peter and Andrew and Philip, which Mark tells us was “in
the land of Genesareth,” and therefore on the west shore
of the lake. Supposing Tell Hum to be Capernaum, and
the western Bethsaida to be on the site usually assigned to
it, this hypothesis would give us two Bethsaidas only six
miles apart, not a very probable supposition; or else we
have to suppose that the land of Genesareth extended
across the Jordan to the east side, which we know to have
had another name, and to have been in another province; or
to suppose, as Dr. Thomson—who resolutely refuses to have
two Bethsaidas—does, that half the town was on one side of
the Jordan and half on the other, and that the half on the
west side was called Bethsaida in the land of Genesareth,
though the plain of that name is five miles distant. Moreover,
there are no ruins conveniently placed to support the
presumption, which is very strained. Altogether the subject
is one which has puzzled every Biblical geographer
hitherto, and, after a careful examination of all their arguments,
I find myself just as much in the dark about it as
when I entered upon the investigation. As, therefore, after
visiting all the disputed localities, I do not feel any the more
competent to enlighten your readers, I will confine myself
to describing the different places which have been suggested
as the sites of these cities, as well as of others which I visited
in the section of country to the east of the Jordan, some
of which I was the first to discover, and none of which have
been positively identified.

Meantime, the scene, which the tradition of many centuries
located erroneously as the spot upon which the miracle
took place, is exactly above us as we wind along a rocky
path cut in the precipice which overhangs the Sea of Galilee.
This huge impending crag is crowned by an artificial
plateau, which is two hundred feet long by one hundred
broad, and in the northwest angle are the remains of a wall
and the ruins of a building, probably a fortress of some
sort. This spot was known in the middle ages as the Mensa
Christi, or Table of Christ. In olden time the great Damascus
high-road ran just below, and the fort above doubtless commanded
this pass; but it has become impassable, and the
path now follows the channel of an aqueduct hewn out of the
living rock. For about two hundred yards we find ourselves
riding along the narrow floor of this ancient watercourse.
On our left the smooth rock rises precipitously, and on our
right it forms a wall from three to four feet high, over
which we could drop a stone perpendicularly into the waters
of the lake. The aqueduct which thus forms our singular
roadway is about three feet wide; emerging from it,
after we turn the angle of the rock, we find ourselves overlooking
a little bay, into which rushes a brawling torrent,
the largest which enters the lake excepting the Jordan, and
which here turns a mill. It is, however, only a few yards
long, as it bursts from the ground in great force, in what is
by far the most powerful spring in Galilee, and is, without
doubt, the celebrated Fountain of Capernaum mentioned by
Josephus as watering the plain of Genesareth. This it did
by means of the aqueduct which we had already traversed,
the distance from the fountain to the plain not being above
a mile. Besides the principal fountain, which is estimated
as being more than half the size of the celebrated source of
the Jordan at Banias, there are four smaller fountains, all
more or less brackish, and varying in temperature from 73°
to 86°.
</p>

<p>
One of the special subjects of interest connected with
these fountains is the presence in them of the remarkable fish
called the coracinus. The only known habitats of this fish
in the world are in the Nile, in a fountain which I have also
visited in the plain of Genesareth, called Mudawara, and in
<span class="pageno target" title="226" id="page-226"></span>
this spring. Josephus accounts for its existence here, as
well as in the Nile, by a hypothetical subterranean water
communication with the great river of Egypt. Modern
geologists point to it as an evidence of the fact that in some
long bygone period Palestine might have been included in a
great Ethiopian basin. However the circumstance is to be
accounted for, it is most remarkable, and was doubted until
Canon Tristram verified it twenty years ago by a somewhat
singular experience. Crossing the little stream which issues
from the fountain of Mudawara and flows into the lake, and
which happened to be very low at the time, he was surprised
to observe a quantity of fish wriggling along in single file,
and so close together that the mouth of one touched the tail
of the one before it. In places there was so little water
that they had to flop across intervals of almost dry land;
here he caught them easily with his hand, and, as many
averaged three feet in length, he was not long in making a
good bag. What surprised him most, however, was to find
that as soon as he laid hold of one it began hissing and
screaming like a cat. Making a bag of his cloak, he carried
them off in triumph to his camp, which was three
hours distant, and could hear them hissing and caterwauling
in it all the way. He describes them as being a most
delicious fish to eat, something like an eel in flavor, and
possessed of extraordinary vitality, as some of them were
still living after they had been two days out of the water.
The last volume just issued by the Palestine Exploration
Fund contains a print of this extraordinary creature, which
has a long, slender body, apparently not much thicker than
that of a good-sized eel, with two long fins, one on the back
and one on the belly. The mouth, with its long, cartilaginous
streamers (I do not know the ichthyological term for
them), somewhat resembles that of a catfish. I unfortunately
had no means of fishing for them on the occasion of my visit,
and they did not happen to be migrating to their spawning
grounds, which they were evidently doing when Tristram
caught them; but my late experiences on the shores of the
lake have been so full of interest that I propose to make
another visit in the spring, when I hope to go supplied with
tackle, and to give you my own piscatory experiences.

<span class="pageno target" title="227" id="page-227"></span>

<p>
There is a small tract of fertile land in the rear of the
mill, but no ruins except those connected with mills or water-works.
Nevertheless, it is impossible almost to conceive
that a position so favored by nature should not have been
the site of a town, and it is on this spot that many geographers
place the western Bethsaida. There are no apparent
grounds for their doing so beyond the necessity of finding a
spot somewhere which should support their hypothesis. If,
however, they must have a second Bethsaida, I should rather
put it a mile farther off, at Khan Minieh, instead of so
very close to Capernaum as this would be, always supposing
Tell Hum to be Capernaum, which is only two miles distant
from this spot. Dr. Thomson's theory that El-Tabghah, the
modern name of this place, was the grand manufacturing
suburb of that large city, from which its fountain took its
name, seems to me rational. Here were the mills, not only
for it, but for all the neighbourhood; so also the potteries,
tanneries, and other operations of this sort would be clustered
around these great fountains, a theory somewhat borne
out by the name, Tabghah, which resembles the Arabic word
Dabbaga, meaning tannery.
</p>

<p>
There is no doubt that in this neighbourhood somewhere,
probably on the plain of Genesareth, was the location of a
town far older than any of those whose sites we are now discussing,
and this is the Chinneroth mentioned in the Old
Testament, from which the lake, in days long anterior to
those of Christ, took its name, and which the Talmud renders
Ginizer, which is therefore doubtless identical with Genesareth.
Indeed, it may be noted as a curious fact, which
has been forced upon me by these investigations, that the
towns noticed in the Gospels, excluding the large cities,
such as Jerusalem, Tyre, and Sidon, are almost all places
not mentioned in the Old Testament. Nazareth and Capernaum,
Bethsaida, and Chorazin and Tiberias are names never
occurring in the Hebrew Scriptures; and the scenery of the
life of Christ lies, as a rule, apart from the centres, religious
or political, which reappear again and again in the earlier
episodes of Jewish history.

</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, Jan. 20.—Perhaps the most interesting spot in the
world to those deeply under the influence of that charm
which association lends to places hallowed by the ministrations
of the Founder of Christianity is to be found in a desert,
rock-strewn promontory on the northwest shore of the
Lake of Tiberias; for among these piles of hewn blocks of
black basalt still remain the ruins of a great synagogue, within
whose walls, the foundations of which may still be distinctly
traced, were collected the multitudes who flocked to
hear the teaching of Christ. While modern tourists resort
in crowds to Jerusalem to visit the mythical sites which are
supposed, upon the vague basis of ecclesiastical tradition, to
be identified with episodes in the life of the great Teacher,
scarcely one ever finds his way to this remote locality lying
just out of the beaten track along which Cook leads his
herds of sightseers; and yet it is probable that the greater
part of that period in the life of Christ, the record of which
is contained in the four Gospels, was spent at Capernaum,
which the most careful investigation, by the highest authorities
in such matters, has identified with these ruins of Tell
Hum, amid which I was just now standing. Here it was
that Christ cured Peter's mother-in-law, restored the paralytic,
called Matthew, cured the centurion's servant, raised
Jairus's daughter from the dead, and obtained the tribute
of money from the mouth of a fish. It was here that he
spoke the parables of the sower, the tares, the treasure hid
in the field, the merchant seeking goodly pearls, and the net
cast into the sea. Sir Charles Wilson, whose researches on
this spot led him to identify it as being the site of the city
of Capernaum, believes this synagogue was, “without doubt,
the one built by the Roman centurion (Luke vii. 51), and,
therefore, one of the most sacred spots on earth.” It was
<span class="pageno target" title="229" id="page-229"></span>
in this building, if that be the case, that the well-known discourse
contained in the sixth chapter of John was delivered;
and it was not without a strange feeling, says the same explorer,
“that, on turning over a large block, we found the
pot of manna engraved on its face, and remembered the
words: “I am that bread of life. Your fathers did eat
manna in the wilderness and are dead.”
</p>

<p>
This very synagogue was probably the scene of the healing
of the demoniac and of the delivery of many of those
divine lectures on faith, humility, brotherly love, and formality
in worship, as we read at the end of one of them:
“These things said he in the synagogue as he taught in
Capernaum.” Perhaps it was in the little creek, where a boat
was now riding at anchor only a few feet from the shore,
that Christ taught the people from the boat so as to avoid
the crush of the multitude. It was doubtless in one of
these inlets that James, the son of Zebedee, and John, his
brother, were mending their nets when, being called, they
left their ship and followed him; and it was on this coast
that Andrew and Peter were casting their nets when they
were summoned to become fishers of men. It has a higher
claim to be called the birthplace of the religion which
has since revolutionized the world than any other spot upon
it; and it is a matter of some surprise to me that neither the
Greek nor the Roman Catholic churches, in their zeal to
discover holy places, which may serve as levers for political
intrigue, have yet thought of occupying this one, which
would seem the holiest of all. Perhaps it would lead to a
comparison between their practice and the teaching of which
it was the scene, which might give rise to some inconvenient
reflections.
</p>

<p>
Apart from their associations the ruins themselves are not
particularly striking. They cover an area of about half a
mile in length by a quarter in breadth, and consist chiefly
of the black blocks of basaltic stone which formed the walls
of the houses. The traces of the synagogue, however, remain
sufficiently for the building to be planned. Built of
white limestone blocks, it must have formed a conspicuous
object amid the black basalt by which it was surrounded.
It was seventy-five feet by fifty-seven, built north and south,
<span class="pageno target" title="230" id="page-230"></span>
and at the southern end had three entrances. Many of the
columns and capitals have been carried away, but enough
still remain to convey some idea of the general plan and
aspect of the building. The capitals are of the Corinthian
order, and there were epistylia that rested upon the columns
and probably supported wooden rafters. There are also remains
of a heavy cornice and frieze. The exterior was probably
decorated with attached pilasters.
</p>

<p>
Two miles north of Capernaum are the ruins of Chorazin.
There is no difficulty in identifying the site, which may be
determined partly by the itineraries of early travellers, and
partly by the similarity of the modern name, Kirazeh. The
path to them leads up the sloping, rocky hillside, but, owing
to the peculiar character of the masonry, which is barely to
be distinguished at one hundred yards from the rocks which
surround it, the extent and importance of these ruins have
been overlooked until quite recently. They cover an area
as large as, if not larger than, those of Capernaum, and are
situated partly in a shallow valley, partly on a rocky spur
formed by a sharp bend in the Wady Kirazeh, here a wild
gorge eighty feet deep. From this spot there is a beautiful
view of the Lake of Tiberias to its southern end; and here,
too, are gathered the most interesting ruins—a synagogue
with Corinthian capitals and niche-heads cut, not, as at Capernaum,
in limestone, but in hard black basalt. The dimensions
of this building are about the same as those of the
one at Capernaum, but the interior is a mass of ruins. Two
pedestals still remain <i>in situ</i>, and a portion of the wall. The
characteristic of this synagogue is an excess of ornamentation
of rather a debased kind. The niches are most elaborate,
and remain as sharp as when they were cut in the hard
material used. The mouldings of the door-posts are similar
to those used in other synagogues, and there are many
stones cut with deep mouldings and pieces of classical cornices
strewn among the ruins.
</p>

<p>
Many of the dwelling-houses were until recently in a tolerably
perfect state, the walls being in some cases six feet high;
and, as they are probably of the same class of houses as that
in which Christ dwelt, a description of them may be interesting.
They are generally square, of different sizes, the
<span class="pageno target" title="231" id="page-231"></span>
largest, however, not over thirty feet square, and have one or
two columns down the centre to support the roof, which appears
to have been flat, as in the modern Arab houses. The
walls are about two feet thick, built of masonry or of loose
blocks of basalt. There is a low doorway in the centre of
one of the walls, and each house has windows twelve inches
high and six wide. In one or two cases the house was divided
into four chambers.
</p>

<p>
We now pushed on to the point where the Jordan enters
the lake, distant about three miles, for it was only on the
other side of that river that my exploration of new ground
might be said to commence. I had been attracted hither by
rumours which had reached me of a remarkable stone which
was said to be in the possession of an Arab, on which were
pictorial representations and inscriptions. As my information
on the point was somewhat vague, I rode up to a Bedouin
encampment, near which was also a collection of mud
hovels occupied by fellaheen, which were situated on the
west bank of the river. They were naturally so suspicious
that I pretended at first to be merely anxious to have a
guide to show me the ford, but it was not until the old
sheik himself appeared that I could find any one willing to
offer me the slightest assistance. They gazed at me with
open-mouthed stupidity, real or assumed, and the sight of
silver scarcely moved their stolidity. Far different was it
with the eagle-eyed old gentleman who, having seen the
group assembled round us, strode up from the Bedouin encampment,
and at once entered into the spirit of the thing.
Not only was he prepared to show me the ford, but, for adequate
consideration, would take me to all the ruins in the
neighbourhood, with the positions of which he professed an
accurate acquaintance, if I would only wait until he went
for his horse. This I was only too happy to do, and in a
few minutes he galloped up with his <i>kufiha</i> and <i>abbaye</i>
fluttering in the wind, a genuine son of the desert. We
forded the Jordan by following the little bar which it makes
on entering the lake, the water reaching to our saddle-flaps,
and, following the shore, here a grassy plain for half a mile,
reached a large square building, charmingly situated near
some trees on the margin of the water. This was the granary
<span class="pageno target" title="232" id="page-232"></span>
and storehouse of the great Arab proprietor of the
neighbourhood, the only building with any pretensions for
miles round; and it was the local agent of this man, himself
a resident in Damascus, whom I now found to be in possession
of the relic I had travelled so far to see. My disappointment
may be easily conceived when I was told that he
had gone to Damascus, and would not return for a week.
My disgust, as I squatted beneath the walls of this detestable
building, making a lunch off hard-boiled eggs, and revolving
burglarious schemes of entry, all of which came to
naught, may easily be imagined. The fact that the building
itself was surrounded by ruins was small consolation,
for these consisted only of large hewn blocks of black basalt,
and the foundations of houses which were clearly to be
traced, but the area they covered was not extensive, and I
could not find any indications of any public building. The
name of the spot is El-Araj, which signifies The Lame, but
I was unable to identify it with any Biblical locality.

<a href="#toc-45">DISCOVERY OF AN ANCIENT SYNAGOGUE.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, Feb. 2.—I narrated in my last letter the disappointment
I experienced when, after making a pilgrimage to the
north end of the Lake of Tiberias for the express purpose
of seeing some stones covered with inscriptions and pictorial
representations, said to be in the possession of the agent of
a rich Arab proprietor, I found their owner gone and the
relics locked up in a building of which he had taken the key,
and all ingress to which was impossible. The Bedouin sheik
whom I had picked up as a guide at a neighboring encampment,
seeing my chagrin, comforted me by the assurance
that if I would only follow him he would take me to a place
where I could find others which were quite as good. I
mounted my horse, therefore, in somewhat better spirits, as
from his description of the locality I knew it must have
escaped the attention of all former travellers, and consoled
myself by the reflection that a discovery of some importance
might still be in store for me.
</p>

<p>
Our way took us due north across the fertile plain of
the Butêha, an alluvial expanse about two miles in length
by one in breadth, formed by the detritus which, in the
course of ages, has been washed down the Jordan, and the
winter torrents which rush into the plain down the wadys
that descend from the elevated plateau of Jaulan.
</p>

<p>
The Butêha is not unlike the plain of Genesareth. Both
are well watered and extremely fertile. Butêha has the
largest and most prominent brooks, Genesareth the most
numerous and abundant springs. The old traveller, Burckhardt,
says that the Arabs of the Butêha have the earliest
cucumbers and melons in all this region. It was on this
plain, at the foot of the hill or “tell” we were now approaching,
that Josephus fought the Romans under Sylla, concerning
which battle he says: “I would have performed great
<span class="pageno target" title="234" id="page-234"></span>
things that day if a certain fate had not been my hinderance,
for the horse on which I rode and upon whose back I fought
fell into a quagmire and threw me to the ground, and I was
bruised on my wrist and was carried into a certain village
called Cuphernome or Capernaum.”
</p>

<p>
The tell which rises from this plain, about a mile and a
half from the lake, is thickly strewn with ruins, consisting
of hewn blocks of black basalt, with which, in the ancient
times, all the houses in this region were constructed; but as
yet no traces of any large building have been discovered.
It has, indeed, been very rarely visited, but it is considered
by many to be the site of Bethsaida-Julias and the scene of
the miracle of the loaves and fishes. At present all we
know for certain is that one of the Bethsaidas was somewhere
in the Butêha; that Josephus in his descriptions advanced
it to the dignity of a city, both by reason of the
number of inhabitants it contained and its other grandeur;
and that inasmuch as the plain of the Butêha contains many
heaps of ruins, none of any very great extent, any of them
may be Bethsaida, while if it were a large city in our modern
acceptation of the term, the whole plain would not be
large enough to contain it.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, one is much struck in exploring the ruins of the
country by the limited areas which they cover. I am afraid
to say how many sites of ruined towns I have visited in
Palestine, certainly not less than forty; and I think one
could crowd them all into the area occupied by the ruins of
one large ancient Egyptian city—Arsinoë in the Fayoum,
for instance; but then the ruins of an Egyptian city are
composed mainly of mounds of potsherds, while these consist
of large blocks of building stone, either limestone or
basalt, measuring generally two feet or two feet six one
way, and a foot or eighteen inches the other. Then they
are usually comparatively near together; all around the Lake
of Tiberias, and in the country in its vicinity, they are generally
not more than from one to three miles apart; so that
this section of country must have been very thickly peopled.
The ruins of Et-Tell are now built over by the Arabs, who
live in a squalid village among the basalt blocks which
formed the mansions inhabited by the more highly civilized
<span class="pageno target" title="235" id="page-235"></span>
race which occupied the country in the days when all
this region was the favourite haunt of Christ and his disciples.
</p>

<p>
Leaving Et-Tell on our left, we followed the east bank of
the Jordan for more than a mile. This river is here very
rapid, and, splitting into numerous streams, whirls past the
small islets they form. It is the very ideal of a trout stream,
on which on some more propitious occasion I propose to
cast a fly. Meantime, even had I been provided with the
requisite tackle, I should have been obliged to forego the
temptation. It was on the steep rise of a hill, about a hundred
yards from the river, that my guide suddenly stopped.
Here was a small collection of Arab hovels, recently constructed,
and it was in their search for stone, last summer,
that the natives had for the first time uncovered the ruin
which now met my delighted gaze.
</p>

<p>
I found myself in the presence of a building the character
of which I had yet to determine, the walls of which were
still standing to a height of eight feet. The area they enclosed
was thickly strewn with building-stones, fragments
of columns, pedestals, capitals, and cornices. Two at least
of the columns were <i>in situ</i>, while the bases of others were
too much concealed by piles of stone to enable me to determine
their original positions. My first impression, from the
character of the architecture which was strewn about, was
that this was formerly a Roman temple; but a further and
more careful examination convinced me that it had originally
been a Jewish synagogue, which at a later period had
been converted to another use; probably it had been appropriated
by the Byzantines as a basilica, or Christian
church. This was the more probable, as the existing walls
had evidently been built upon the foundations of a former
structure. The massive stones were set in mortar, which
is not the case with the synagogues hitherto discovered;
and I should doubtless have been completely at fault in
classing this building had my attention not been already
directed to the remains of the synagogues brought to light
recently by the exertions of the Palestine Exploration
Fund.
</p>

<p>
I was now fortunately in a position to compare the dimensions,
<span class="pageno target" title="236" id="page-236"></span>
ground-plan, and architectural fragments which were
strewn about, with those which distinguish the synagogues
already discovered, in regard to whose original character
there can be no doubt, as the Hebrew inscriptions and sacred
Jewish symbols carved on the lintels prove it. The building
measured forty-five feet by thirty-three, which is exactly
the measurement of the small synagogue at Kefr-Birim.
The columns were exactly of the same diameter. The floor
was depressed, and reached by a descent of two steps, which
were carried around the building in benches or seats each a
foot high, the face of the upper one ornamented by a thin
scroll of floral tracery. These features occur in the synagogue
at Irbid. There was a single large stone cut into the
shape of an arch, which had evidently been placed on the
lintel of the principal entrance, like the one which stands to
this day over the doorway of the great synagogue at Kefr-Birim.
The niches, with the great scallop-shell pattern
which distinguishes them, almost exactly resemble those of
the synagogue of Kerazeh or Chorazin; while the cornice,
which was extremely florid, and not unlike what in modern
parlance is called “the egg-and-dart pattern,” though differing
in some respects from the cornices hitherto observed,
was evidently of the same school of design. The capitals
were two feet three inches high, and Corinthian, in the same
style and of the same dimensions as those of the small synagogue
of Kefr-Birim, and there was the upper fragment of
two semi-attached fluted columns, with Doric capitals, the
ditto of which is to be found at Irbid. The two columns in
situ exactly answer in position those of several of the synagogues,
and though the position of the door, which was in
the centre of the western wall, was somewhat unusual, this
was accounted for by the fact that the building had been
excavated from the hillside, so that the top of the east wall,
nine feet of which was still standing, was level with the surface
of the slope of the hill.
</p>

<p>
The only convenient entrance was in the wall of the side
immediately opposite to it. The name of this most interesting
locality was ed-Dikkeh, a spot hitherto unvisited by any
traveller. Indeed, if it had been visited, it would have been
passed unnoticed, for its antiquarian treasures have only
<span class="pageno target" title="237" id="page-237"></span>
been revealed for the first time a few months ago. The
word ed-Dikkeh means “platform,” a name, considering its
position, not inappropriate; but I have not been able to
identify it with any Biblical site.
</p>

<p>
The area of ruins apart from those of the synagogue
itself was not very large, but the situation was highly picturesque.
Half a mile to the north of where we stood the
Jordan forces its way through a gorge which I hope some
day to explore, while immediately below us it rushed between
numerous small islets. Opposite the hills swelled
gently back from its western bank, behind us they rose
more abruptly to the high table-land of Jaulan, while to the
southward stretched the plain of Butêha, with the Lake of
Tiberias in the distance.
</p>

<p>
Meantime the few wild-looking natives who inhabit this
remote locality clustered around me, as they watched me
measuring and sketching, with no little suspicion and alarm.
“See,” said one to another, “our country is being taken
from us.” My request for old coins only frightened them
the more. They vehemently protested that not one had
been found, an assertion which, under the circumstances, I
felt sure was untrue; nor did the most gentle and reassuring
language, with tenders of backshish—which was nevertheless
greedily accepted—tend to allay their fears. I have
forgotten to mention what was perhaps the most interesting
object of all, and this was the carved figure of a winged
female waving what seemed to be a sheaf in one hand, while
her legs were doubled backward in a most uncomfortable
and ungraceful position. It was on an isolated slab about
six inches thick, and two feet one way by eighteen inches
the other.
</p>

<p>
The area of the hillside all around was strewn with the
blocks of building-stone of which the town had been built.
It had apparently not been a very large place, but as the
villagers will probably continue their excavations for their
own purposes next summer, it is not at all unlikely that they
may bring some more interesting remains to light. I earnestly
impressed upon them the necessity of preserving
these, promising another visit next year, when I would reward
them in proportion to the carvings, coins, or other antiquities
<span class="pageno target" title="238" id="page-238"></span>
they could provide for me; but they listened to my exhortation
with such a stupid and suspicions expression of
countenance that I did not derive much encouragement from
their reluctant consent.

<a href="#toc-46">CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RUINS OF
SYNAGOGUES.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, Feb. 16.—I described in my last letter the discovery
of the ruins of an ancient Jewish synagogue at a spot
on the east bank of the Jordan, about three miles north of
the upper end of the Lake of Tiberias. As the question of
ancient Jewish synagogues is one of great interest, in regard
to which considerable misapprehension prevails even
among archæologists, I may be excused for entering upon a
short disquisition upon the subject, as I am not aware that
the great light which has been thrown upon it by recent
Palestinian research has yet been distributed in a popular
form to the general public, and the old and recognized authorities
are often misleading. For example, “Smith's Dictionary
of the Bible” contains a long article on Jewish synagogues
which has hitherto been considered the great authority
on the subject, in which I observe that it states under
the sub-head “Structure:”
</p>

<p class="block-quote">
“Its position, however, was determined. It stood, if possible, on the highest
ground in or near the city to which it belonged. Its direction, too, was
fixed. Jerusalem was the Kibleh of Jewish devotion. The synagogue was
so constructed that the worshippers, as they entered and as they prayed,
looked towards it.”
</p>

<p>
This may have been the case in respect of the earlier synagogues,
long anterior to the time of Christ, the traces of
which have been lost, but in the case of eleven which have
been discovered by the officers of the Palestine Exploration
Fund, since the above was written, no such rules have been
adhered to. These all date either from the time of Christ,
or shortly before it, to three centuries after it. We know
they were synagogues, and can approximately calculate
their dates, from the Hebrew inscriptions found on some of
them, and from the emblems with which they were ornamented,
<span class="pageno target" title="240" id="page-240"></span>
such as the pot of manna, the seven-branched candlestick,
and other purely Jewish devices. In the cases of
these synagogues, many of which I have seen, the builders
have by no means selected the most prominent positions;
the existing remains have, with two exceptions—at Irbid and
at ed-Dikkeh, where the ground would not admit of such an
arrangement—their doors on the southern side, so that every
Jew entering would have to turn his back on Jerusalem.
The ark, if there was one in these synagogues, would necessarily,
in that case, be placed at the northern end, and the
worshippers would therefore have to pray with their backs
to Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
We know, besides, how abhorrent to the Jews were the
figures of animals, and the popular impression has been that
none such were permitted to decorate their synagogues; yet
in these synagogues we find them prominently carved in
stone in six out of the eleven. The carved figure I found
at ed-Dikkeh makes a seventh, and they probably existed in
the others and in greater quantities than those already noted,
but have been destroyed by the Mohammedans as contrary
to their religion. As may be supposed, as they were all
built at nearly the same period, there is a great similarity
in the architecture of the synagogues recently discovered.
It is of an extremely florid and somewhat debased Roman
type. In all of them the same class of mouldings is observable.
There is a great resemblance in the niches and cornices,
while the capitals show some variation, being Corinthian,
Doric, and Ionic. There is also a great similarity in the
ground plan and in the position of the columns. In the
case of a Roman temple these are all in colonnades outside
the building, in cases of synagogues they are all within it.
There should be no possibility, therefore, of confusing a synagogue
with a Roman temple, even though it abounds with
Roman architecture; but it is not always so easy to distinguish
it from an early Christian church, or basilica, where
the columns were also inside. The reason that the architecture
of these latter synagogues was so purely Roman in
character is to be found in the conditions under which they
were built. Shortly after the destruction of Jerusalem by
the Romans, the Jewish Sanhedrim was established at Tiberias,
<span class="pageno target" title="241" id="page-241"></span>
under a patriarchate whose authority was recognized
by the foreign communities at Rome and in Asia Minor,
and large numbers of these came to live in the district,
while alms poured into the treasury at Tiberias from all directions.
It thus became very wealthy, and the centre of a
great Jewish population. It was recognized by the Romans,
and by them granted many indulgences, and, during the
reign of Antoninus Pius, <span class="sc small">A.D.</span> 138&ndash;161, increased in power
and influence.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of the third century the Jews were in
high favor with the Emperor Alexander Severus, who was
even called the Father of the Synagogue, and this name
may have been given him from his influence over the erection
and architecture of these buildings. It seems, therefore,
almost a certainty that the Roman emperors aided and
inspired the erection of these synagogues. They were built
by Roman labor, for the Jews, being immersed in commercial
pursuits, by using Roman workmen, obtained much finer
results than we are led to think they would themselves have
been capable of. No synagogues of the kind have been
found in other countries, though there were many in Babylon
and in the colonies of the Jews, and this type has never
been perpetuated in later works, while we have seen how
many points in their religion were disregarded in their design
and ornamentation. We may therefore suppose that
they were forced upon the people by their Roman rulers at
a time when they were completely submissive to their power,
and directly they were able they deserted such pagan buildings
as a disloyalty to their religion. It is stated that Rabbi
Simon, son of Jochai, is the founder of many of these
buildings. Indeed, it is related that he built with his own
money twenty-four synagogues in this part of the country.
As he was a most fanatical teacher of the law, it is evident
that if he erected so many buildings in such violent contradiction
to many points of his own religion, he must have
done it under great pressure. These synagogues built under
Roman auspices were probably only an alternative evil;
they had to choose between having them or none at all.
With the exception of one on Carmel, and a problematical
one at Shefr-Amr, about six miles from Haifa, all the synagogues
<span class="pageno target" title="242" id="page-242"></span>
hitherto found have been within the immediate limits
of what was formerly the patriarchate of Tiberias. The
fact that the building at ed-Dikkeh would be included in
this district is an additional reason for assuming it to have
been one of this class of synagogues, and, if so, we should
probably be accurate in fixing its date at somewhere in the
first or second century after Christ.
</p>

<p>
From ed-Dikkeh I proceeded under the guidance of the
old sheik, who was much pleased at the satisfaction which I
evinced at his successful leadership thus far, in an easterly
direction to another place, where he assured me that the
villagers had also been at work getting out stone during the
summer, and had unearthed some more old ruins. Our way
led us along the flank of the Jaulan hills, with the plain of
the Butêha on our right, and, after a ride of about an hour,
we reached a village of huts, in the midst of which was the
anticipated excavation. I could not quite expect such another
stroke of luck as that which had befallen me at ed-Dikkeh,
but yet I had no reason to be dissatisfied. Here, upon
a terrace built of large blocks of basalt about five inches in
height, I found a curious condition of things. The villagers
had laid bare, eighteen inches below the surface of the earth,
the cement floor of an old chamber about twenty feet in one
direction. I could not tell how far it went in the other, as
it was still covered with earth, but where it abruptly terminated
it revealed, about eighteen inches beneath, another
floor of some building of much older date, across which it
had been built diagonally. This floor was of stone. It, too,
had been cleared for some distance by the natives, and upon
it was standing, at intervals of six feet apart, five solid cubes
of stone, measuring two feet each way, which had probably
been the foundations or lower stones on which had been
placed the pedestals of columns. As this lowest floor was
three feet below the present surface of the ground, the top
of these stones was one foot below it, and the line of them
may have continued, though only five had been uncovered.
I have no means of conjecturing what the building may
have been. I found many fragments of columns and capitals
strewn around among the ruins, which covered a larger
area than those at ed-Dikkeh, and which, like them, are a new
<span class="pageno target" title="243" id="page-243"></span>
discovery, though what its results may be must depend very
much upon further excavation. I impressed upon the villagers
here, as I had already done at ed-Dikkeh, if, in the
course of their excavating for stone, they came upon any
with inscriptions or pictorial representations, to preserve
them; but I felt, as I did so, that my words fell upon deaf
or rather unwilling ears. They gazed at me with alarmed
stolidity, either not understanding or not caring to understand,
and evidently dominated by the fixed impression that
my proceedings implied in some way the future ownership
of the soil. I looked from here wistfully up a valley, at the
mouth of which this ruin was situated, and at the head of
which others were reported to exist, but circumstances prevented
me at the time from pushing my explorations in this
direction. Indeed, travel in this part of the country is attended
with many difficulties, some political and some material,
among the latter the chief one being, if one is unprovided
with a tent, the question of where one is to spend the
night. If, on the other hand, one is provided with a tent,
it involves a much larger retinue, increased expense, excites
even more distrust among the natives, and becomes sometimes
dangerous from arousing their cupidity, and this necessitates
having guards and escorts, which are the cause of
endless quarrels and annoyance, as the more people you have
with you the less are you your own master to go where you
like, and the more difficult it is to provide for man and beast.
It is a choice of evils at best of times, and the worry and discomfort
can only be compensated for by good luck in obtaining
results, and this is by no means always to be secured,
though thus far on this particular journey I had had no reason
to complain. I now propose to tempt fate on the highlands
to the east of Lake Tiberias, with what success remains
to be seen.

<a href="#toc-47">A NIGHT ADVENTURE NEAR THE LAKE OF
TIBERIAS.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, February 28.—The tourist who follows the ordinary
track of Palestine travel from Jerusalem to Damascus
inevitably passes Tiberias. Standing on the flat roof of the
convent, where, if he is not one of a Cook's party, he is compelled
to lodge, he has a splendid view of the lake and of
the precipitous cliffs opposite, which descend abruptly to its
margin from the elevated plateau behind, that averages two
thousand feet above the level of the lake. That sheet of
water being nearly eight hundred feet below the sea-level,
the only engineering problem which presents itself to the
consideration of the surveyors who have been engaged in
tracing a railroad line between Haifa and Damascus is how
to ascend from this depression to the highlands above.
</p>

<p>
The solution of the problem is to be found in a large wide
valley called the Wady Samak, which is exactly opposite
Tiberias, and up the unknown recesses of which our tourist
looks with longing eyes. Practically this wady is a sealed
book to the Palestine traveller. To explore it he would have
to obtain special permission from the government, with a
guard, and be exposed to all manner of extortion from his
dragoman, who would take advantage of his ignorance to
magnify the dangers and add to the already existing obstacles.
Indeed, one of the most singular characteristics of
Palestine travel is the close proximity of unknown and unexplored
districts to beaten tracks. Just as it often happens
in a large city, that in the immediate neighborhood of one
of the most frequented thoroughfares there are back slums
inhabited by thieves and criminals, into which no respectable
person penetrates, so, in Palestine, within ten miles of a
place like Tiberias, there are spots as yet untrodden by the
foot of the explorer; but these are all to the east of the lake
<span class="pageno target" title="245" id="page-245"></span>
and of the Jordan. Almost every inch of western Palestine
has succumbed to the exhaustive researches of the Palestine
Exploration Fund.
</p>

<p>
It was on a gloomy winter afternoon that I found myself
skirting the eastern shore of the lake with the view of attacking
the mysteries of this interesting valley—interesting
from a practical point of view, because I wanted to look at
the possible gradients which it might offer for a railway,
and still more interesting from an archæological point of
view, because I felt sure that in searching for gradients I
should find ruins. But the search was undertaken under
difficulties. I was without a tent, because my journey partook
of the nature of an exploratory dash, and a tent would
have been an encumbrance. I was without a guide, because
my guide had deserted me in consequence of one of those
misunderstandings which are not uncommon between travellers
and their guides; but I had two companions, baggage
animal and servant, and an amiable soldier, upon whom, in
case of trouble, it was supposed we should be able to rely
for protection and aid.
</p>

<p>
Owing to a variety of causes, principally arising from a
desire to find ruins where there were none, and to map certain
wadys which are incorrectly laid down in the maps, we
were about two hours later than we should have been when
we reached the mouth of the wady. The clouds were lowering
ominously, there had been no sun all day, and now that
luminary seemed to have given up the attempt to shine upon
us in despair, and to have made up his mind, in a fit of disgust,
to retire permanently to rest. I felt, considering the
journey up the unknown wady, which we still had to perform
without a guide before I could hope to reach a resting-place
(I did not look forward to its being much of a sleeping-place),
that it had no business to get dark so early. However,
it was still broad daylight, and we took our bearings
by compass as carefully as was possible, and were encouraged
by observing that the track we were on was a broad and
well-beaten one, and which, as the formation was white limestone,
would show plainly even when it got dark. The valley
I knew to be about seven miles long. The village we
were bound for, the only village in it or near it, was at its
<span class="pageno target" title="246" id="page-246"></span>
head. We had only to keep going straight up, and the path
we were on would surely lead us to it.
</p>

<p>
This fond delusion I hugged to my soul as we pushed on
as rapidly as our wearied steeds, which had been travelling
since daybreak, would allow us. The breadth of the valley
in a bee-line from one edge of the plateau above us to the
other was not less than two miles. It was a broad valley,
with many shoulders running into it from both sides, and
terraces here and there of cultivated land, the crops the
property of wandering Bedouins, who come here in winter
to sow them, and come back in spring to gather them.
Down the centre of the valley brawled, over a rocky bed, a
mountain brook, even in the dryest season a respectable
trout stream, and often after heavy rains an impassable torrent.
On the present occasion, however, it was behaving
itself respectably, and gave us no trouble. It was fringed
with oleanders, and here and there received tiny tributaries,
which all helped to produce more vegetation than is usual in
Palestine valleys, and to enhance the beauty of scenery the
natural features of which were strikingly picturesque. As
long as it was light I could see natural terraces on the flanks
of the valley, up which it would be easy to take the line.
Then I saw where long curves must be taken, winding up
lateral hollows, through which we could twist the line up
the two thousand feet it had to ascend, and lengthen out the
seven miles of the wady to a distance which would suffice
for the required gradient.
</p>

<p>
Assuredly when that long-looked-for and much-to-be-desired
line is made, the stretch up the Wady Samak will be
one of the most romantic and interesting sections upon it,
while its well-watered slopes will doubtless tempt the speculative
agriculturist or stock-farmer to intrude upon domains
now appropriated by a few wandering Arabs, whose scanty
flocks might be increased tenfold without consuming half its
pasture, and who do not cultivate a tithe of its fertile soil.
</p>

<p>
While thus indulging in airy imaginings of the future,
darkness gradually closed in, and I became suddenly aware,
as so often happens in this world, that all my calculations
would have been sound in regard to my finding my way if
they had not been based upon thoroughly delusive premises.
<span class="pageno target" title="247" id="page-247"></span>
The cause of my error may be summed up in the one word,
basalt. I had forgotten one of the most remarkable geological
features of this part of the country, and this is, that
only the lower stratum of the range which rises from the
east shore of Lake Tiberias is of limestone. All the rest is
basaltic, and this formation is of vast thickness. The whole
of this district is, indeed, an immense volcanic field, consisting
of irregular heaps of amorphous lava and disintegrating
scoriæ, with mounds of globular basalt. So that when darkness
came on everything below me, as well as all above,
seemed suddenly to have become as black as night. The
path had disappeared as if by magic, and I called a halt, and
we found ourselves on a patch of black rock, with exactly
similar patches of black rock all around us. The outlines of
the hills had vanished, the path had led us up from the bed
of the torrent, so we no longer had that to guide us. To attempt
to descend to it would have been madness, as we might
have fallen over a precipice in the darkness; indeed, we were
afraid to move, except with extreme caution, in any direction.
We had a compass and matches, and knew that by keeping
due south we might, if no accident befell us, and the rocks
permitted a passage, ultimately reach the plateau; but we
also knew that the direction of our night-quarters was due
cast; but here we ran the greater risk of tumbling into unknown
transverse gorges with precipitous cliffs. We cautiously
worked south, but our progress soon became barred
by thorny brushwood, and we had to face the alternative of
a night out-of-doors without water or anything to drink, and
a very limited supply of food.
</p>

<p>
We were just bracing ourselves to this unpleasant prospect,
when, in a southwesterly direction, we suddenly saw a
gleam of light; it lasted for a moment, then seemed to go
out. But that one ray was one of hope, and we steered cautiously
for it. We had been scrambling by compass in the
dark for about half an hour, and were just beginning to despair,
when the bark of a distant dog put new energy into us,
and not long after, around the shoulder of a hill, we came
upon an encampment, and were greeted by the furious yells
of the mob of noisy curs which infest the tents of the Bedouins.
It was a startling apparition to burst upon these
<span class="pageno target" title="248" id="page-248"></span>
nomads in their remote retreat—horsemen of a type they had
never seen before, and an armed soldier. Such children as
were awake set up a dismal squalling, the women cowered
tremblingly over their camp-fires under the pent roof of black
camels' hair. All the side of the tent being open, its whole
internal economy was exposed to view, and enabled us to
judge of the slight protection in the way of bedding or
clothing or covering of any sort which was provided against
the inclemency of the season.
</p>

<p>
Meantime the men had gathered round us, half timidly,
half threateningly. The presence of the soldier suggested
fear and suspicion, while the smallness of our party encouraged
the bolder ones to look defiant. As far as I could
make out in the darkness there were about a dozen tents
here in all—apparently the fag end of an insignificant tribe
whose name I forget. It was at first impossible to induce
any one at that late hour to act as guide. Even abundant
offers of backshish failed to shake their suspicion, which
was to the effect that we wished to decoy one into durance
to act as a hostage until some arrears of taxes which they
owed the government should be paid up.
</p>

<p>
The other alternative was that we should take up our
quarters in the sheik's tent, whether he liked it or not, which,
with a piercing wind blowing, accompanied by sleet, was
not a very pleasant prospect. He seemed to relish it as little
as we did, and finally consented to be our guide as we made
some silver gleam in the firelight. As he seized his eighteen-foot
lance and mounted his ragged steed he looked like some
Arab Don Quixote; and as the camp-fire threw its ruddy
glow upon a group of wild-looking women, with dishevelled
hair and tattooed chins, crooning over a pot like the witches
of “Macbeth,” and upon barelegged men, as they flitted to
and fro between the black tents, I thought I had seldom
gazed upon a more weird and unreal-looking scene.
</p>

<p>
How our guide could find his way up the rocky hillside
and across the prairie remained a mystery during the long
two hours that we followed him. Of this I feel sure, that
we scrambled up places in the dark that we should never
have thought of facing by daylight. The very horses
seemed to have become desperate, and to have abandoned
<span class="pageno target" title="249" id="page-249"></span>
themselves to their fate. At last we dismounted and scaled
the rocks like goats, every one, man or beast, doing the best
he could for himself on his own account, and so at last,
wearied and half-starved, for we had fasted for about ten
hours, we reached the goal of our endeavour, too tired to
see what an utterly miserable hole it was.
</p>

<p>
I passed a wretched night in a room in the middle of
which a fire had been built, which filled it with smoke, for
it had no other exit but the door, which it was too cold to
keep open. Around the fire were stretched fifteen Arabs,
who quarrelled with a government official, whom they were
compelled to entertain, about their taxes, until they exhausted
themselves, and then they exchanged their discordant wrangling
for no less discordant snoring. After replenishing exhausted
nature with the eggs which was all that my host
could provide me with, and a tin of canned meat, I vainly
tried to follow their example, but was too busily occupied
in scratching to think of anything but fleas, and so tossed
and tumbled and longed for the morning, when I proposed
to enter upon a new field of exploration, for this was the
village of El-Al, where I had heard that ruins existed; and
as I had every reason to believe that in ancient times this
neighbourhood had been the centre of a large population,
I felt sure that they had left interesting traces, which were
yet to be discovered.

<a href="#toc-48">KHISFIN.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, March 15.—There is no part of ancient Palestine
which offers a more fertile field for antiquarian research than
that portion lying to the east of the Jordan, which fell to
the share of the half-tribe of Manasseh. In Biblical times
a part of it was called Golan, and its modern name of Jaulan
is almost identical with its ancient appellation. It is to this
day the finest grazing land in all Palestine, as it was in the
days of old, when Job fed his vast flocks and herds upon its
more eastern pastures, but it is now very sparsely inhabited.
The sedentary population has all been driven away by the
wandering tribes of Bedouins who have appropriated the
country; the very few villages that remain are squalid and
miserable, and the inhabitants live in terror for their lives,
for they never know what day, or rather night, the Arabs
may not be down upon them, and carry off their stock.
They surround their houses, therefore, with large yards enclosed
by stone walls, and it was in one of these that I found
a lodging on the night that I had so nearly been obliged to
spend in the wilds of the Wady Samak. Attached to these
yards are large stone vaults, capable of containing great
herds of cattle, and some of them apparently of great antiquity.
In the one in which I staked my horses I found,
on examining it in the morning, part of a Corinthian column,
still <i>in situ</i>, standing to a height of about six feet. I failed
to discover any more, but the vault was so dark that my
examination was carried on with difficulty, and I had no time
to spend over it. The sheik's house in which I lodged, and
to which this vault belonged, was evidently, however, built
on the site of what had formerly been a building of some importance,
for in the yard, to my surprise and delight, I came
upon a prostrate statue of a woman, life size. The head was
severed from the body, and the feet had been broken off at
<span class="pageno target" title="251" id="page-251"></span>
the ankles, but it was a fine specimen of Greek statuary.
Both the features and the drapery were beautifully executed.
The feet I found <i>in situ</i>, the ankles just appearing on a level
with the ground. On clearing this away I laid bare the feet,
which were still firmly fixed on the original pedestal, which
it would have required a great deal of labour to disinter. It
is not improbable that the pedestal is covered with carving
in <i id="bassorilievo">basso-rilievo</i>, and I promise myself at some future time to
dig it up. In the meantime both feet and pedestal cannot
be safer than where they are, more especially as my companions
secured the head. This the sheik was induced to
part with for $3. The body was too cumbersome to carry
away now, as a camel would have been needed for its transport,
and, as it is not of much value without the head, it may
be considered secured by the possession of that portion.
</p>

<p>
The statue apparently represented Artemis, as the left arm
clasped what seemed to be a quiver for arrows. The right
arm was unfortunately broken away, otherwise the statue
would be perfect when put together. The pedestal, without
doubt, contains an inscription describing the statue and the
goddess represented upon it. I was sorely tempted to devote
a day to its examination, but, in that case, I should
have been compelled to give up visiting some other spots of
interest which had never before been investigated, and the
hardships and discomforts of these preliminary dashes into
the wilds, more especially in the depth of winter, are so
great that one is not tempted to prolong them—my present
object being rather to know where to go at some future time,
when the conditions, political and otherwise, may be more
favourable than they are now. I therefore did not linger
longer than was absolutely necessary at this place. I had
seen enough to prove to me that it would, in all probability,
amply repay a fuller investigation, and I determined without
delay to push on to a village called Khisfin, which I was
extremely anxious to examine, as it has hitherto escaped the
careful attention of all former travellers. And yet, from
the records which I have been able to examine in regard to
it, it must have been a place of considerable importance in
mediæval history, though hitherto my efforts to trace it back
to an earlier date than the beginning of the tenth century
<span class="pageno target" title="252" id="page-252"></span>
or to identify it with any Biblical site have been in vain.
Yakubi, an Arab geographer, who lived about the year 900
<span class="sc small">A.D.</span>, mentions it as one of the chief towns of the province
of the Jordan. In his day Syria was divided into three provinces,
namely: The province of Damascus, the province of
the Jordan, and the province of Palestine. Yakut, in the
thirteenth century, mentions it as a town of the Hauran district,
below Nawa on the Damascus road, between Nawa
and the Jordan. Khisfin was also at one time a fortress of
the Saracens, as it is further mentioned as the place to which
Al Melek Al Adil, Saladin's son and successor, fled after
having been routed at the battle of Beisan by the Crusaders,
who advanced upon him from Acre. As it is mentioned as
being one of the chief towns of the province, so long ago as
900 <span class="sc small">A.D.</span>, it is probable that its importance dates from a
much older period, as indeed was indicated by some of the
ornamentation which I found there.
</p>

<p>
Securing my host, the sheik, as a guide to a locality which
promised to be so full of interest, we started at a brisk pace
across the plateau, in the teeth of a bitterly cold east wind
and driving sleet, and, after riding an hour, came to the
ruins of Nab, situated on a small mound. They consist of
blocks of basalt building-stone, some traces of foundations,
some fragments of columns and capitals, and a tank, dry at
the time of my visit, but which evidently held water at some
time of the year. It had, apparently, been much deeper at
a former period, only the two upper courses of masonry being
new visible. It was oval in shape, and measured sixty yards
by thirty. This place does not appear to have been previously
visited or described. Shortly after leaving it I observed
masses of black stone, which, on nearer approach,
proved to be the walls of a fortress that, my guide told me,
was Khisfin itself. It loomed strikingly up from the grassy
plain, and gave rise to pleasing anticipations as I galloped
impatiently up to the base of the walls, and, jumping off my
horse without even waiting to tether him, in my excitement,
scrambled up a breach to see what was inside. I looked
down upon a ruin-strewn area, but, alas, no columns, nor
capitals, nor signs of Roman remains. This had evidently
been in turn a Saracen and a Crusading construction. The
<span class="pageno target" title="253" id="page-253"></span>
outer walls measured sixty-eight yards one way by fifty-four
the other. They are nine feet in thickness, and are eight
courses of stone in height, the stones being from one foot
to one foot six inches square; but some are much larger.
Within the fort are the traces of a second or inner wall,
forming a sort of keep in the centre; but the whole area
was too much encumbered with ruin for any accurate plan
to be possible in the limited time at my disposal.
</p>

<p>
A little beyond the fort stood the village itself. All the
intervening and surrounding fields were thickly strewn with
the large hewn blocks of black basalt of which the houses
of the former population had been constructed, and which,
to judge from the area which they covered, quite justified
the description of Yakubi, that in his day this was one of
the chief towns of the province, and the centre of a very
large population. The present squalid inhabitants, few in
number, seemed to live in a perfect quarry of these old
building-blocks. No difficulty had they in finding material
wherewith to build their houses, their large cattle vaults,
and enclosing yards. They simply piled the tumbled masses
of stone in a little more regular order, one above another,
to make walls of any height or thickness they chose, without
mortar or cement, and had houses that would last forever.
As all the stones were beautifully squared and shaped,
they had far more symmetrical walls, thanks to the ancients,
than if they had been left to themselves. These black, massive
huts all jumbled together with their vaults and yards,
without regular streets or lanes, formed one of the strangest
looking villages I ever saw. In some cases the walls were
formed of stones placed diagonally, in others horizontally,
in others perpendicularly. The very roofs were of stone,
with earth on the top of them to fill up the cracks. Where
hewn stone is so abundant and wood almost impossible to
obtain, it is astonishing what uses the former can be put
to. And now came a search which I would willingly have
protracted over days instead of over minutes, which were
all I had to give to it. To “do” Khisfin thoroughly one
ought to examine carefully every stone in every house, besides
the acres of stones by which the present village is surrounded.
As it was, I went into as many houses as I had
<span class="pageno target" title="254" id="page-254"></span>
time for, and made sketches of what ornamentation I found.
The natives had evidently used as lintels for their doorways
the stones which had served the ancients for the same purpose.
These were usually four or even five feet long, and
many of them were ornamented with curious devices. They
were in part Crusading and in part Saracenic. There were
the tablets with half-effaced escutcheons, rosettes, bosses,
crosses, and other Crusading emblems, which left no doubt
in my mind that this must have been at one time an important
Crusading fortress, though in the only book relating to
the crusades which I happen to have by me no mention is
made of it. There were several of those curious carvings,
difficult to describe, which characterize Saracenic architecture
as an evidence that the Moslem conquerors of the crusaders
had also had a hand in its adornment; but what was
more interesting, there were floral wreaths and carved devices
which are a feature in Byzantine art, which gave clear
evidence that before the conquest of this province from the
Byzantine empire in the seventh century it had been an important
city of that civilization which immediately succeeded
the Roman.
</p>

<p>
The important question which I could not determine was
whether, in the old Roman times, it had been a place of note.
There can be little doubt that a future examination, of a
more minute character than I was able to give, would determine
this point, and it is not at all impossible that upon the
old stones might be found seven-branched candlesticks, pots
of manna, or emblems of a still older date, which would
carry it back to Jewish times. Meanwhile I looked anxiously,
but in vain, for an inscription which might throw some
light on the subject, and it is certain that amid such a mass
of ruin such are to be found. All my inquiries for old coins
only tended to alarm the villagers, who looked on my proceedings
with their usual suspicion, and associated my visit
and my desire for old money with their taxes, which is the
only idea that the fellah of Palestine seems able to connect
with the visit of a prying and inquisitive stranger. The
whole of the country which surrounds Khisfin is susceptible
of the highest degree of cultivation; the land is eminently
fertile and almost a dead level, capable of producing abundant
<span class="pageno target" title="255" id="page-255"></span>
crops, if there were any people to cultivate it. As it
is, it is allowed to run to waste. It affords pasture to their
flocks, but these are scanty, through fear of the Arabs, and
the people, unable to rely upon the government for protection,
and, indeed, being only aware that there is a government
through its tax-gatherers, are sullen and suspicious
and discouraged, and utterly without energy to do more
than provide themselves with the barest necessaries of life.

<a href="#toc-49">FURTHER EXPLORATION AND DISCOVERY.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, March 31.—From Khisfin, the ruins of which I
described in my last letter, I struck off in a westerly direction
under the guidance of the sheik who had been my
host the night before, and who, now that he was convinced
that I had nothing to do with tax-gathering, and was only
possessed by what must have seemed to him an insane desire
to find old stones and make pictures of them, took an evident
pleasure in ministering to such a harmless form of insanity;
in fact he became quite a bore on the subject. As
he was naturally unable to appreciate any distinction between
one old stone and another, he was constantly making
me ride out of my way to look at some weather-beaten piece
of basalt which had a fancied resemblance to a wild animal;
or to a mound, the ruins on which belonged to a village that
had been deserted within the last twenty years. Still I
never could afford to treat his assurances with indifference,
as there was always the possibility, until I satisfied myself
to the contrary, that the stones to which he was guiding me
might possess interest; and indeed on one occasion they did,
for they turned out to be the ruins of a Roman town, where
a few fragments of columns and capitals still remained to
bear testimony to the particular civilization to which they
belonged, and which, although they did not present any
striking architectural features—indeed, the remains were
somewhat insignificant—it was always a satisfaction to have
been the first to discover. The name of these ruins was
Esfera.
</p>

<p>
Near them a very singular and unpleasant accident occurred
to me. I rode my horse to drink at what seemed a
muddy puddle, which was about ten or twelve feet in diameter.
Instead of being content to drink at the margin, he
took two steps into it, and suddenly disappeared head first;
<span class="pageno target" title="257" id="page-257"></span>
that is, his head disappeared, his hind-quarters remained for
a moment poised above the water just long enough to enable
me to throw myself off backward into about two feet
of puddle. We had walked into an overflowed well. When
his hind-quarters at last went down into it his head came
up, or, at all events, as much of it as was required for
breathing and snorting, which he did prodigiously, evidently
in a panic of terror, while I stood drenched and shivering on
the bank in the cold east wind and sleet, wondering how we
were ever to get him out. The poor beast was out of his
depth, but the dimensions of the well were too limited to
enable him to swim, or even to scramble freely. Fortunately
I had sent on my saddlebags by my servant, or the
animal would have been hopelessly weighted down. As it
was, it was only by the united efforts of the party tugging
at the bridle and stirrup-leathers that, after many futile
efforts, at the end of each of which he fell back and for a
moment disappeared altogether, we ultimately succeeded in
extricating him. Meantime my own plight was in the last
degree unenviable, the more especially as I was not in very
good health at the time, a consideration which induced my
companion, with a truly commendable devotion, to take off
his nether garments and insist on my wearing them instead
of my own, while he performed the remainder of the day's
journey in the slight protection which he wore beneath
them.
</p>

<p>
It was in this guise, and while still discussing my strange
mishap, that our attention was suddenly arrested by finding
ourselves surrounded by what are perhaps the most interesting
of antiquarian objects, a number of dolmens. In a very
limited area—none of them were over two hundred yards
apart—I counted twenty. The subject of these rude stone
monuments of a prehistoric age is so interesting that I will
venture on a few words in regard to them.
</p>

<p>
The most remarkable point about Syrian dolmens is, that
while they have been found in numbers to the east of the
Jordan, not one has been discovered in Judea or Samaria,
and only two or three in Galilee; and those are doubtful
specimens. Indeed, it is only of late years that they have
attracted the notice of explorers east of the Jordan; but
<span class="pageno target" title="258" id="page-258"></span>
since attention has been specially directed to the subject,
we have constantly been having new discoveries. Six years
ago I found one of the first at a spot not more than twenty
miles from the hitherto unknown field I had now come upon.
That dolmen stood alone, and being previously unaware of
their existence in this part of the world, I examined it with
the greatest interest. Since then Captain Conder, during
his hurried survey in Moab, has found above seven hundred
in that part of the country, and the result has been that the
controversy as to the purpose for which they were designed
has been reopened with renewed vigor.
</p>

<p>
The dolmen, which usually consists of three perpendicular
stones forming three sides of a small chamber, with a single
huge covering slab as its roof, is found in almost every part
of the world except America, though I saw a notice in a
paper the other day of one having been discovered in Missouri.
There are stone monuments in Central America, I believe,
somewhat resembling them, but I am not aware that
the point has been satisfactorily determined, and it is of the
highest interest that it should be, as it would establish the
existence of general contact between the universal families
of that ancient stock which preceded both the Aryan and
Semitic races, and which belonged, therefore, to the illiterate
and prehistoric age of the use of bronze and of flint.
</p>

<p>
Dolmens have been found in almost every country in
Europe. They are numerous in the British Isles, France,
Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Prussia, and the south of Russia.
I have myself found them in the mountains of Circassia,
and they exist in Italy, Spain, and Portugal, in great
numbers in Algeria and the north coast of Africa, in Asia
Minor and India, and we have recently heard of them in
Japan! Wherever they exist are generally to be found
menhirs, or single monolithic stones, and stone circles, such
as Stonehenge in England, or long rows of standing stones,
such as those to be found at Carnac in Brittany, or smaller
stone circles, such as are common to the east of the Jordan.
Those found in Syria are generally placed in a position commanding
an extensive view and in close proximity to water.
They are either “free standing,” that is, quite alone and
isolated, or they are covered by cairns of stones; or they
<span class="pageno target" title="259" id="page-259"></span>
are, as the majority were in this instance, perched upon
piles of stones.
</p>

<p>
It has been hitherto supposed that in all these cases they
were sepulchral monuments, but it has been recently suggested
that those alone beneath the cairns may have served
this purpose, and those which were free standing or on cairns
may have been used as altars. The basis for this conjecture
consists in the fact that the flat covering stones of the Syrian
dolmens are very often provided with cups or hollows, which
may have served to hold sacrificial oil; and, moreover, the
free standing dolmens are often on smooth rock, so that it
would not be possible to inter a body beneath them. I have
seen the covering slab to be as large as eleven feet long by
five wide, though those in the field I was now examining
were much smaller, some of the covering stones not being
above five feet by three or four; this was probably owing
to their being of basalt, which is much heavier than ordinary
stone. Nearly all were trilithons, the covering slab
being sometimes held in position by pebbles inserted under
it; and in many instances they appeared to have a slight
slant which was not the result of accident.
</p>

<p>
The natives here call them “Jews' burial-grounds,” showing
that the local tradition is in favor of their being sepulchral
monuments, though it is very certain they date from a
period long anterior to the Jews. Indeed, the probability is
that the disappearance of these monuments from western
Palestine, where they no doubt existed, is due to the command
to destroy heathen monuments. Thus, in Deuteronomy,
we find again and again repeated injunctions to overthrow
the Canaanite altars, and to break or smash their pillars.
These exhortations we find carried into practice by Hezekiah
and Josiah in Judea, and as the Book of Deuteronomy
was held sacred by the ten tribes as well as by the two, we
are justified in supposing that they carried out the order in
Samaria and Galilee. But the land to the east of the Jordan
always contained a mixed population, over which the kings
of Israel and Judah exercised but little control. Baal worship
was rife in Bashan, Gilead, and Moab in the days of
Jeremiah, and the reforming zeal of Hezekiah did not affect
the land where Chemosh and Ishtar, Baal, Peor, Nebo, and
<span class="pageno target" title="260" id="page-260"></span>
Meni yet continued to be worshipped. This accounts for
dolmens not having been found, except with a few doubtful
specimens, in Galilee to the west of the Jordan.
</p>

<p>
With the exception of the roughly excavated hollows in
the covering slab, these rude stone monuments of Syria
have, so far as is known, neither ornamentation nor rune nor
other mark of the engraver's tool. In comparatively few
instances they are made of hewn stone, very roughly cut,
but generally they are of natural blocks and slabs entirely
unformed. Thus, if there be any comparative scale of antiquity
on which we can rely connected with the finish of
the monument, the Syrian dolmens may claim to be considered
among the oldest of their kind.
</p>

<p>
The word “dolmen,” usually rendered table-stone, should,
according to Max Müller, be more properly translated
“holed” stone, implying either a gateway, such as is formed
by the trilithon, or else applying to menhirs and dolmens
pierced with a hole, as in the case of the Ring stone, the
Odin stone, and a peculiar class of holed dolmens. The one
I saw in Circassia was of this latter category. Instead of
three stones supporting the covering slab, as is almost invariably
the case in Syria, there were four, and in the centre
of the fourth was a circular hole, about eighteen inches in
diameter, or just large enough to allow a thin man to
squeeze through. Some have supposed these holes to be
connected with some sacrificial rite, others to be due to the
superstition that the dead could not rest in peace in tombs
without an inlet for air. But the whole subject is encompassed
with mystery, and affords material for endless conjecture.
</p>

<p>
So also do the sacred stone circles, of which I have seen
several to the east of the Jordan. They are held in the
greatest veneration by the Arabs, who can give no rational
explanation of the sacred character they possess, except that
they have been sacred from immemorial time. Here, again,
these may either have originally had a sepulchral character,
or they may have had reference to that peculiar and most
ancient worship of which the menhir or monolith was the
emblem, for in some instances menhirs are placed in certain
fixed positions in regard to the circles, or they may have
<span class="pageno target" title="261" id="page-261"></span>
had an astronomical significance. It is singular that to
this day the reverential attitude of the Arab is outside of
the circle with his face to the rising sun, while in India the
same circles are to be found among the Khonds in connection
with the worship of the rising sun, the tallest member
of the circle being towards the east.
</p>

<p>
The conclusions at which we may proximately arrive with
reference to these interesting monuments are—according
to Captain Conder, to whose researches I am indebted for
many of the foregoing remarks—that the menhir is the emblem
of the earliest religious idea suggested by the creative
potency; that the circle may either have a sacred significance
connected therewith, or be a sepulchral enclosure;
that the dolmen, when free standing, is more likely to have
been an altar than a tomb, but when buried beneath a cairn
it may have been sepulchral; that the cairn is not always
sepulchral, being sometimes a memorial heap; and that all
are relics of a long-buried past.

<a href="#toc-50">THE DISCOVERY OF UMM EL-KANATAR.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, March 20.—When we had sufficiently satisfied our
curiosity with regard to the dolmens, which I described in my
last letter, the sheik who was our guide disappeared suddenly
over the edge of the plateau on which they stood, down what
seemed to be a precipice of black basalt. His reply to our
anxious inquiry as to whither he was leading us—“to very
old stones, with writing on them”—was a talismanic utterance
which at once overcame all hesitation. On such occasions
there rises in the mind of the cold and weary and half-starving
traveller (and I answered to this description at the
moment) visions of possible Moabite stones, trilingual inscriptions,
and all the other prizes which reward successful
Palestine research. I felt, therefore, ready to make any
plunge into unknown depths that he might choose to suggest,
but certainly this was a bad one. Some two thousand
feet below us, distant not more than seven miles, gleamed
the still waters of the Sea of Galilee. We stood on the
upper edge of one of the branches of the Wady Samak,
which leads down to it. To our left, scarce a mile off, we
could see the old crusading ruin of the Kasr Berdawil, or
Baldwin's Castle, perched on a promontory the sides of
which are sheer precipices, thus offering to the old warriors
a position of magnificent strength. It is one of the least
known of the Crusading strongholds, but I was assured by a
friend, who, so far as I know, is the only traveller who has
visited it, that beyond a few crumbling walls there was absolutely
nothing to be seen, so, as I had better game in prospect,
I did not turn aside to it, as I had originally intended,
but resolutely prepared to risk my neck amid the basalt
blocks of the cliff down which the sheik was now disappearing.
Fortunately, though it was a bad descent, it was not
<span class="pageno target" title="263" id="page-263"></span>
a long one. I never could understand how my horse managed
it, for I had left him to take care of himself, finding
my own legs a safer method of descent; but in these lonely
regions the instinct of not getting separated from the rest
of the party is as strong with animals as with men, and they
may generally be trusted to follow their companions.
</p>

<p>
After scrambling down about five hundred feet we came
to a sort of bench or narrow plateau, on the flank of the ravine,
and on turning round a huge rock of black basalt came
suddenly upon one of the most delightful scenic surprises
which it was possible to imagine. Here in this wild, inaccessible
spot, in ages long gone by, the ancients had evidently
contrived a secure and enchanting retreat, for it was provided
with the first requisite of beauty and of pleasure—a
copious fountain of water. It lay in crystal purity in a still,
oblong pool, beneath the perpendicular black rock. Against
the rock, and projecting from it, were two large arches which
had been constructed of solid masonry, with blocks of stone
of immense size. One of these arches was almost destroyed,
but the other was still in perfect preservation. It measured
twenty-three feet in breadth, sixteen feet in height, and six
feet six inches in depth, this being therefore the width of
the fountain, which was also twenty-three feet long and
about two feet deep. To my astonishment it contained
numbers of small fish, which was the more surprising as it
possessed no apparent outlet; but it was too cold and fresh
and sparkling to be anything but a living stream, and probably
disappeared by a subterranean passage through a large
crevice which I observed in the rock.
</p>

<p>
The wide-spreading branches of a venerable oak which
grew directly in front of the arch threw a delightful shade
over it, while delicate ferns clothed the sides of the grotto,
which seemed to woo us to a repose and indolence which
was, alas, under the circumstances, denied to us. On the
keystone of the arch there was a partially effaced inscription.
Though it was sixteen feet overhead, and therefore
inaccessible, I should not have abandoned some attempt to
decipher it had I not felt sure that, even if I were close to it,
it was too much defaced by the storms of ages to be legible.
I feel little doubt, however, about its having been in the
<span class="pageno target" title="264" id="page-264"></span>
Greek character; while on a slab of stone at the side of the
spring I found carved the figure of a lion, which was in
good preservation, and of which I made a sketch.
</p>

<p>
The sheik was so impatient to take me somewhere else
that he scarcely allowed me time to avail myself of this
tempting spot to take the refreshment of which I stood
much in need. He told me the name of the place was Umm
el-Kanatar, or, being interpreted, “the place of arches,” a
name evidently derived from its most striking feature, and
he said there was a ruin close by. This turned out to be not
a hundred yards distant, and consisted of walls still standing
to a height of about seven feet, composed of three courses
of stone, the blocks averaging about two feet one way by
two feet six the other, but being in some instances much
larger. These walls enclosed an area of about fifty feet by
thirty-five, which was covered by a mass of ruins which had
been tossed about in the wildest confusion. It was quite
evident that it had been the work of an earthquake. Six
columns, varying from ten to twelve feet in height, rose
from the tumbled masses of building-stone at every angle.
It was impossible without moving the huge blocks which encumbered
their bases and hid their pedestals, and balanced
them in all sorts of positions, to tell whether they were <i>in
situ</i> or not. The huge moulded stones which formed the
sides of the entrance, though still one above the other, had
been shaken out of position, but they bore all the character
of carving which is peculiar to Jewish architecture, and at
once led me to conclude that here, as at Eddikke, I had discovered
the ruins of an ancient Jewish synagogue, dating
probably from the first or second century <span class="sc small">A.D.</span> This impression
was confirmed as I came to examine the ruin more
narrowly. Here was the large stone cut in the shape of an
arch, which had probably stood upon the lintel of the principal
entrance; and here was a fragment of a handsome cornice
of the same peculiar pattern I had found at Eddikke,
resembling the egg-and-dart pattern of modern ornamentation.
Here were the columns inside the walls of the building
instead of outside, which would have been the case had
it been a Greek temple, and here were the massive stones,
not set in mortar, which would have been the case if it had
<span class="pageno target" title="265" id="page-265"></span>
been an early Christian basilica or church. Here, too, was
a stone on which was carved the representation of an eagle,
in deference to the prejudices of the Roman conquerors
under whose auspices these synagogues appertaining to the
Jewish Patriarchate of Tiberias were built, the work having
evidently been executed by Roman workmen.
</p>

<p>
I could find no inscription, but it would take days to
examine all the stones thoroughly, and it is most probable
that a careful investigation of them would reveal something
which would throw a still more definite light on the character
and period of the building, though I confess I entertain
very little doubt in respect to either. Altogether I regard
these ruins of Umm el-Kanatar as the most interesting
discovery I have yet made, and as being well worthy another
visit and a more minute examination than I was able
to bestow upon them.
</p>

<p>
The sheik now appeared to think he had done his duty,
and expressed his intention of returning to his village and
of leaving me to find my way down the Wady Samak by
myself. This I did not object to, as there was still plenty
of daylight, and I could, in fact, make out from where I was
now standing the position of the ruins of Kersa on the margin
of the lake, whither I had despatched my servants and
baggage animals direct from my last night's quarters, with
orders to await my arrival there.

It was up the branch of the wady that I was descending
that the projected railway from Haifa to Damascus would
have to be led, and it was some satisfaction to see that it
offered facilities for the ascent of the line. The scenery was
in the highest degree picturesque, the sides of the valley
sometimes sloping back for some distance to the foot of the
basalt precipices which formed its upper wall; at others
these approached and formed projecting and overhanging
promontories, like that on which the Kasr Berdawil was
situated. We scrambled down by a rugged path to the
small stream at the bottom with the view of following it, if
possible, to its outlet on the lake, but this we soon found to
be impracticable, and were assured by a Bedouin, whose hut
we finally reached on its margin, that we must cross it, and
make an ascent on the opposite side. This led us by a
<span class="pageno target" title="266" id="page-266"></span>
roundabout, hilly, but picturesque route across numerous
and intersecting wadys, and past one ruin, of which nothing
remained but the black blocks of hewn basalt. I was
fortunate enough, however, to meet a man who told me the
name, which I added to my list of unknown ruins, and so,
after much scrambling, we reached at last the white limestone
strata, and the purling brook again with its fringe of
oleanders, and could see in the distance the one large solitary
tree which we had given as our rendezvous, and beneath
which our servants were standing, that marks the site of the
ruins of Kersa, or the Gergesa of the Bible, where Christ
healed the two men possessed with devils, and suffered those
malignant spirits to enter into the herd of swine.
</p>

<p>
There is a discrepancy in the accounts of the Evangelists
in their narrative of the incident. Mark and Luke, in our
version, locate it in the country of the Gadarenes, but
Matthew states it to have taken place in the country of the
Gergesenes. The Vulgate, Arabic, and others that follow
the Vulgate read Gergesa in all the Evangelists, and there
can be no doubt that this is the correct reading, for the simple
reason that the miracles could not have taken place in
the country of the Gadarenes, a district which lies south of
the Yarmuk, and at a long distance from the lake, the principal
town, Gadara, the modern Um Keis, about the identification
of which there can be no doubt, being at least eight
miles from it. Now the account says that “when he came
out of the ship immediately there met him a man,” also that
the herd ran down a steep place violently into the sea. To
do this, if the incident had taken place at Gadara, they must
have descended twelve hundred feet to the Yarmuk, swam
across that river, clambered up the opposite bank, and then
raced for about six miles across the plain before they could
reach the nearest margin of the lake. Scarcely any amount
of insanity on the part of the devils would account for such
a mad career, but in point of fact it does not tally with the
Scripture record, according to which they rushed down a
steep place into the sea. This is exactly what they could do
at Kersa. The margin of the lake is here within a few rods
of the base of the cliff, where there are ancient tombs, out
of which may have issued the men who met Christ on the
<span class="pageno target" title="267" id="page-267"></span>
plateau above; and it is easy to suppose that the swine, rushing
down the sloping cliff, would have enough impetus
to carry them across the narrow slip of shore at its base.
The remains now only consist of long lines of wall, which
may easily be traced, and of a considerable area strewn with
building-stones, which show that it must in old time have
contained a considerable population. This is the more likely
to be the case as it was the chief town of a district which
was called after it. In fact, this picturesque and interesting
Wady Samak, with its evidences of a former civilization,
and its “place of arches” and handsome synagogue, was, in
fact, “the country of the Gergesenes;” and there can be
little doubt that to Christ and his disciples the remote corners
of it, which I had been one of the first to explore, were
intimately known.<a id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>
The ruins of Kersa are a good deal overgrown, and in the
cover which is thus afforded I put up a wild boar. He
dashed away so suddenly, however, that a bullet from a revolver,
which was sent after him, failed to produce any result.
I have little doubt that the old Roman road turned
from the lake at this point up the Wady Samak, as there are
traces here and there indicating such a probability. It will
be a singular commentary on the progress of events if it
turns out that it has taken the best gradient, and if, upon
its ancient track, the scream of the locomotive may in the
near future be heard waking up the long-silent echoes of the
country of the Gergesenes.

<p class="foot"><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
The greater part of the Wady Samak and the surrounding country had,
immediately prior to my visit, been most accurately surveyed by Mr. Gottlieb
Schumacher, the son of the American vice-consul at Haifa, whose admirable
and exhaustive surveys are embodied in the proceedings of the English and
German Palestine Exploration Societies, and who was my companion on the
occasion of our discovery of the ruins of Umm el-Kanatar.

<a href="#toc-51">THE ROCK TOMBS OF PALESTINE.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, April 26.—The fact that I am laboring under a
peculiar phase of insanity, which takes the form of descending
with a light into the bowels of the earth with a measuring
tape, and writing down cabalistic signs of what I find
there, whether it be in a cistern or a tomb, or a natural cavern,
has become pretty widely known among the inhabitants
of the neighbouring villages, and the consequence is that
from time to time I receive information which may minister
to this harmless monomania. The other day, for instance, a
stonecutter whom I had employed on some building operations
came to me with the intelligence that while he and
some villagers had been getting out stone for a house at a
place about twenty miles distant they had unexpectedly
come upon a series of subterranean chambers. His account
was so tempting that, though prepared by experience
for disappointment when acting upon purely native information,
I nevertheless thought the possible results worth an
effort, and proceeded therefore to the village in question,
which was situated in the centre of the Plain of Esdraelon.
The sheik was at first somewhat reluctant to show me the
spot, as the fellahin have an inherent suspicion of all investigations
of this nature, believing them to be mysteriously
connected with the discovery of treasure, which, when
found, they will be accused of having concealed, and punished
for it. He finally consented, however, to lead the
way, and brought me to an opening in the earth, from the
surface of which a flight of nine stone steps led down to a
small paved court, about six feet square, which had now
been emptied of the soil which had previously concealed its
existence. The sides of this court, which were about twelve
feet high, were formed of massive masonry, the blocks of
stone being each from eighteen inches to two feet square,
<span class="pageno target" title="269" id="page-269"></span>
set in mortar. A short vaulted passage, three feet long,
two feet six wide, and five feet high, led from it into a subterranean
chamber of fine workmanship, and in such a high
state of preservation that it was difficult to realize that from
fifteen hundred to two thousand years had elapsed since its
stone floor had been trodden by the foot of man. It was
fourteen feet long, eight broad, and eight feet six in height,
with a vaulted roof, the walls consisting of plain chiselled
stones set in mortar, in courses of from two feet to two feet
six inches in height. On the left of this chamber was a single
koka, or tunnel, hewn in the rock for the reception of a
dead body. The roof was vaulted and of solid masonry.
On the side opposite the entrance was another vaulted passage,
which was seven feet six in length, and led into a
chamber hewn out of the solid rock, twelve feet by ten feet
six, and six feet six in height. This contained three kokim
and a loculus under an arcosolium; but the side of the loculus,
as well as those of the kokim, had been much injured.
The villagers, who had opened these tombs for the first
time only a few weeks before, told us they had only found
human bones in them, but I strongly suspect they had
found ornaments which they were afraid to exhibit, though
I offered them money. One or two glass bottles and earthenware
jars they also said they had found and broken.
</p>

<p>
Not far from these tombs was another smaller excavation,
the entrance to which presented the appearance of an ordinary
cave, but on entering it we found ourselves in a small,
circular, rock-hewn chamber, the floor so covered with rubble
that it was not possible to stand upright. In the centre
of the roof was an aperture eighteen inches square, opening
to the sky, carefully hewn, and from it led a passage of
masonry, the stones also set in mortar, two feet six broad,
and about five feet to the point where it was completely
choked with earth. Had I had time to excavate I should no
doubt have found that it led into a tomb. The entrance to
this passage was almost completely blocked by the capital
of a handsome Ionic column; the column itself was eighteen
inches in diameter. How it ever came to be wedged down
in this underground passage I cannot conceive. Among the
stones in the vicinity which had been unearthed by the natives
<span class="pageno target" title="270" id="page-270"></span>
I found one on which was carved a seven-branched
candlestick, another of Jewish moulding, a sarcophagus,
several fragments of columns, and a monolith standing ten
feet from the <i>débris</i> at its base, with grooves and slots similar
to others which I have seen on Carmel, but taller. I
can only imagine it to have formed part of some olive-pressing
machinery. In the neighbouring rocks were hewn vats
and wine-presses.
</p>

<p>
The discovery of this tomb, with the peculiar characteristics
which marked its construction, and the objects which
surrounded it, afforded a fertile subject of conjecture. In
order that my readers may understand the considerations to
which it gave rise, I must enter a little more fully than I
have hitherto done into the subject of the ancient Jewish
methods of sepulture. These consist of sundry varieties,
and it has been attempted to fix their dates from the variations
which have been observed, as well as to discriminate
by them between Christian and Jewish tombs. So far as
my own investigation goes, I have been unable to fix any
positive rule in the matter, my experience being that one
no sooner forms a theory based upon observation, than one
makes some new discovery which upsets it. Roughly, the
tombs which I have investigated may be divided into the
following categories: 1. Rock-hewn tombs containing nothing
but loculi; 2. Rock-hewn tombs containing nothing but
kokim; 3. Rock-hewn tombs containing both; 4. Masonry
tombs containing either loculi or kokim, or both together;
5. Sarcophagi; 6. Rock-sunk tombs. A rock-hewn tomb is
an excavation made in the solid rock (advantage generally
has been taken of a natural cavern), and round the sides
of the chambers so formed, which vary in dimensions, are
ranged the receptacles for the dead. In some cases these
are more than one chamber. In Sheik Abreikh, for instance,
I counted fifteen opening one into another. Sometimes
these are one above another, and one has to enter
them from below through a hole in the stone roof which
forms the floor of the upper chamber. A koka is a rectangular
sloping space cut into the rock, tunnel fashion, extending
six feet horizontally, sufficiently wide and high to
admit of a corpse being pushed into it. A loculus is a
<span class="pageno target" title="271" id="page-271"></span>
trough cut laterally into the rock, which is arched above so
as to form what is called an arcosolium. This trough is
generally about six feet long, two feet six broad, and two
feet deep. It is thus separated from the chamber by a wall
of rock two feet high. A large tomb will contain as many
as twelve loculi ranged around it.
</p>

<p>
At first it was supposed that the kokim tombs were the
oldest; then it was found that loculi and kokim were sometimes
found in the same tomb; and, indeed, there seems now
to be no reason to suppose that one kind is older than the
other. That the Christians used both is certain from the
fact that Greek inscriptions with Christian ornaments are to
be found over the doors of tombs containing kokim as well
as loculi. Masonry tombs are only found in Galilee, where
they are very rare. Indeed, so far as I am aware, this is
only the sixth that has been discovered; but what gave it a
special interest in my eyes is the fact that the stones were
set in mortar, which is not the case with any of the others,
ancient Jewish synagogues, as well as their masonry tombs,
being built without cement. I therefore had made up my
mind that this was a Christian tomb, the early Christians
having evidently continued the Jewish method of sepulture,
more especially as it is oriented, which is not the case with
Jewish tombs; and, indeed, the character of the masonry
and the fragments of columns and capitals lying about induced
me to place it in the Byzantine period, possibly as late
even as the fourth or fifth century <span class="sc small">A.D.</span> But then I stumbled
upon the stone with the seven-branched candlestick, an
unmistakably Jewish emblem, which threw the date back.
It is true that this stone was not built into the tomb, and
might have formed part of a building of a date long anterior
to it. Indeed, we know that on this spot, which is now
called Jebata, and which is undoubtedly the Biblical Gabatha,
was formerly a Jewish town of some importance, and
its remains have doubtless got mixed up with those of a
later Byzantine period, to which I still think it probable
that the tomb which I discovered belongs.
</p>

<p>
It differs from any I have yet seen in the imposing character
of its entrance. Its flight of nine handsome stone
steps, leading down the open court, and the vaulted passage,
<span class="pageno target" title="272" id="page-272"></span>
with its massive masonry, give it quite a peculiar character.
The entrance to the rock-hewn tomb is usually through a
small doorway from three to four feet in height, just large
enough to permit a man to squeeze through without very
great inconvenience, and it is usually closed by a circular
stone like a millstone, which runs in a groove, and can be
rolled across it, though sometimes the door consists of a huge
curved slab. The sarcophagus is too well known to need
description. The most remarkable collection of them which
I have seen is at Umm Keis, the biblical Gadara, where there
are at least two hundred, many of them ranged in two rows
on either side of the way leading out of the city. They are
of black basalt, and are often beautifully carved and highly
ornamented. I do not think they were so much used by
the Jews as by Christians, though sometimes sarcophagi are
found placed in loculi. At all events, they were not the original
Jewish method of burial, and, if used by them at all,
the habit was one which they probably adopted from their
Roman conquerors.
</p>

<p>
The sunk tombs are common in various parts of Galilee—especially
in the rocky hillsides of the range upon which
Nazareth is situated. They consist of rectangular troughs,
sufficiently large to contain a human body, sunk into the
surface of the living rock, and covered with a huge lid of
stone, sometimes flat, but more often cut conically, so as to
have a high central ridge. I have more than once endeavoured
to remove these from the tombs, which had never been
opened, where they were still <i>in situ</i>, but never happened
to be accompanied by a sufficient number of men or to have
adequate leverage appliances with me. As these stones are
generally about seven feet long, three broad, and from two
to three feet thick, they require the application of no little
force to remove them. They vary in size, however, and I
have seen sunk tombs for babies not above eighteen inches
long. Apart from the interest which attaches to the whole
question of rock sepulture in Palestine, the most interesting
relics of antiquity are generally found in the tombs, while
not uncommonly valuable inscriptions are met with. Many
of them are ornamented with pictorial representations,
which have been laid on with coloured pigment, and the
<span class="pageno target" title="273" id="page-273"></span>
designs are often curious and interesting. Altogether, although
the investigation of these mortuary chambers is
often attended with great difficulty and discomfort, they
frequently furnish results which compensate for the fatigue
that they involve.

<a href="#toc-52">GENERAL GORDON'S LAST VISIT TO HAIFA.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, May 10.—The interest which attaches to the
memory of the late General Gordon must be my apology
for devoting a letter to my personal reminiscences of one
whose singularly pure and lofty character attracted me to
him at a time when he was comparatively unknown. Nothing
is in fact more remarkable than the suddenness of the
notoriety into which he sprang, a notoriety from which he
of all men would have the most shrunk, and of the knowledge
of which, by the singular fatality which isolated him
from the world in his beleaguered garrison, he was to the
last unconscious. Owing to his own modesty and love of
retirement, and to the fact that his life had been largely
spent abroad and in the service of foreign governments, he
was personally almost unknown in London society. His
friends consisted chiefly of his brother officers and a few
congenial spirits whose acquaintance he had made in various
parts of the world. By the public at large he had only
been heard of as “Chinese” Gordon, and few cared to inquire
what manner of man he was.
</p>

<p>
It was just twenty-nine years ago since I first met him in
the trenches before Sebastopol. He was quite a young and
unknown officer at that time, and I should have forgotten
the circumstance had we not again come across each other
three years afterwards in China, and upon comparing notes
found that we had already met in the Crimea. He had not
then been appointed to the command of the “ever victorious
army,” and was still a junior Captain of Engineers. I left
China before he entered the Chinese service, and almost immediately
after his arrival, so that I saw very little of him.
Still, I had seen enough to make me watch his subsequent
career with great interest, but our paths had not again
crossed until one day, about two years ago, I received a letter
<span class="pageno target" title="275" id="page-275"></span>
from Jaffa signed C. G. Gordon, asking for information
in regard to Haifa as a residence, and expressing his intention
of possibly paying me a visit. As I have many friends
of the name, I was puzzled for the moment. The writer did
not mention anything in the letter to give a clew to his
identity, though it was addressed as from one old friend to
another. It was only accidentally that the same afternoon
the vice-consul here asked me if I knew anything of a General
Gordon, as some letters had arrived to his care for an
individual of that name. I at once perceived who my correspondent
must be. I immediately addressed him a cordial
invitation to pay me a visit, which he promptly responded
to, and we spent a few very pleasant days together. The
Hicks disaster in the Soudan had not then occurred, so
that the affairs of that country and its Mahdi had not yet
acquired the notoriety they were destined so soon to attain;
but Gordon's intimate knowledge of the country induced
him to express his opinion in regard to its condition.
</p>

<p>
He deprecated strongly the whole course adopted by the
British government in Egypt from the beginning, warned
me that they underrated the nature of the movement in the
Soudan, to which country he was then in favour of granting
independence under native rulers, was entirely opposed to
English officers at the head of Egyptian troops, thrusting
themselves into the mess, and maintained that the whole affair
should be settled by a civil commissioner, who should
at once be sent by England to the Mahdi to arrange with
him the terms upon which the Soudan should be rendered
independent of Egypt. As at this time the English had not
come into violent hostile collision with the Mahdi, Gordon
declared his conviction that such a mission would be favourably
received, and that a state of affairs might be arranged
which, although not so favourable to the Soudanese as he
could have wished, would leave them better off than under
Egyptian rule. His idea was that if the Mahdi did not show
himself amenable to reason, he might be threatened with a
rebellion of the local Soudanese chiefs, who, he felt convinced,
could easily be induced to combine against him. In
fact, before going to the <span id="Mahdi">Mahdi</span> he would have sounded the
<span class="pageno target" title="276" id="page-276"></span>
feeling of these chiefs, with a view, if necessary, to organizing
a revolt against him.
</p>

<p>
In a word, his view was that the Soudan question should
be settled by the Soudanese alone, that no Egyptians should
be mixed up in the affair; and I have no doubt that if the
British government had thought of availing themselves of
Gordon's services at this juncture, the question of the Soudan
might have been arranged satisfactorily to all parties, except,
perhaps, the Egyptian and Turkish governments. He
was at that time particularly strong on the necessity of a
railway from Suakim to Berber, the concession for which
was being then applied for by English railway contractors,
who were sanguine of success. He assured me that they
were wasting their time; that it was a concession the Egyptian
government would never grant, as they were afraid if
they did that the whole trade of the Soudan would be diverted
to Suakim instead of, as now, coming down to Cairo.
“It is a short-sighted policy,” he remarked, “for without
that railway Egypt will one day not only lose the trade of
the Soudan, but <span id="itself">the Soudan itself.”</span>
</p>

<p>
Not long afterwards there was a report that the concession
had been granted, and he wrote me a long letter of many pages,
which began with warning me not to believe the report, as
it was quite impossible that it could be true, his knowledge
of the Egyptian government convincing him that they would
make promises, but that nothing would ever induce them to
consent to this railway being made, unless they were coerced
into it by the British government. He felt equally convinced
that the British government had no intention of
using their authority in this direction, as, in his opinion,
they should do, and that the report, therefore, was without
foundation. This, in fact, turned out to be the case.
</p>

<p>
General Gordon, after spending a few days at Haifa, returned
to Jerusalem, promising to bring his tents two months
later and pitch them next to mine at Esfia on the summit of
Carmel. I was eagerly looking forward to his companionship
in the delightful wilderness of this mountain, and had
even marked out in my own mind a spot for his camping-ground
within fifty yards of my own, when, to my great disappointment,
I received a letter from him saying that he was
<span class="pageno target" title="277" id="page-277"></span>
so deeply interested in biblical studies at the Holy City that
he felt it his duty to change his mind, as he might never
again have an opportunity of verifying the correctness of
the views he entertained in regard to the typical nature of
its configuration.
</p>

<p>
Not long afterwards I received another long letter from
him on the subject of the Jordan valley canal scheme, in
which he took a warm interest. This led to a correspondence,
as I entirely differed from him as to its practicability. Towards
the end of the year he wrote, saying that he was suddenly
summoned to the Congo, and bidding me adieu. Curiously
enough, in my reply I said that I did not say good-bye,
as I felt sure I should see him again before he left the
country. A few days afterwards he once more turned up at
Haifa. He had embarked at Jaffa for Port Said in a country
sailing craft, and he had been driven by stress of weather
so far out of his course that his crew finally ran in here
for shelter.
</p>

<p>
At this time affairs in the Soudan were in a very acute
stage, and we again discussed them at great length. His
views had naturally undergone a change, as the policy which
had been possible seven or eight months previously was impracticable
now. He felt great doubt whether, if he went
to the Soudan, he could succeed in achieving now what he
was convinced he could have accomplished then, or whether
the policy he had sketched out was longer feasible. “If it
were not for the Soudanese, whom I love,” he said, “the
easy way out of it for the English government would be
to invite the Turks to go, but it is not probable that they
have the sense to make the proposition, or that the Turks
would be such fools as to accept it.”
</p>

<p>
He refused altogether to anticipate the possibility of his
being sent to the Soudan, partly because he felt bound in
honour to go to the Congo for the King of the Belgians, and
partly because he had already had too many differences with
the heads of departments under which he had served, and
was regarded with too little favour, on account of his refusal
to look at every question through official spectacles, to be a
<i>persona grata</i> to the English government. He was detained
here a week, during which time we not only discussed fully
<span class="pageno target" title="278" id="page-278"></span>
the Egyptian and Soudanese questions, but talked over old
times in China, when he gave me many graphic descriptions
of incidents in his Chinese campaigns, which have probably
never been heard of, and which I now regret I did not
record. His modesty was such that I could only compel him
to narrate his own adventures by a process of severe cross-examination.
</p>

<p>
One of his marked peculiarities in conversation was his
employment of phrases which he had himself coined to represent
certain ideas. Thus he would say of a man: “So-and-so
is a very good fellow, but he would never break his
medal,” by which he meant that he was ambitious. Gordon
himself, when the Emperor of China gave him, in return for
his services, a very valuable gold medal, fearing that the sense
of gratification he derived from it might prove a snare to
him, broke it up and gave away the pieces. Hence the
allusion.
</p>

<p>
Again, he would say, if asked if he knew so-and-so. “I
only met him once and then he rent me.” From which I
understood that he had felt it his duty on that occasion to
give the individual in question a word of good advice, and
that the only thanks was that the man resented it, or, in
Scripture phraseology, “turned again and rent him.”
</p>

<p>
One day I observed him writing notes on a slip of paper.
He asked me the Christian names of two friends who were
staying with me. I told him, and feeling, I suppose, that my
curiosity ought to be gratified, he said, “I am writing them
down on my prayer list.”
</p>

<p>
Another day, after using some very strong language in
regard to a very high personage who shall be nameless, he
added quickly, “but I pray for him regularly.” All this
without a vestige of cant. If there was a thing he detested
it was hypocrisy, and I trust I may not be suspected of it
when I say that the thought of Gordon at Khartoum, and
the knowledge that I was on his prayer list, was calculated
to produce a lump in my throat. He was full of fun
and a most cheery companion with those he knew intimately.
He never forced a conversation in a religious channel.
He brought with him from Jerusalem a raised model which
he had made, to carry out his theory that the hill upon which
<span class="pageno target" title="279" id="page-279"></span>
the greater part of the city was built was in the form of a
woman. Taking the mound commonly identified as “the
place of the skull” as the head, the lines of topographical
configuration certainly bore out the resemblance in a very
remarkable manner. He was far more full of this than
either of the Soudan or the Congo, and was taking it with
him to Brussels to show the King of the Belgians. “I suppose,
as you are the king's guest, you will go and stay at the
palace,” I remarked. “No, certainly not,” he replied; “I
shall go to a hotel. I don't want the king's servants to see
my old comb.” He left here on the 18th or 19th of December,
1883, and walked to Acre, twelve miles, to meet the
steamer that was to take him direct to Marseilles. He sent
his luggage in a carriage.
</p>

<p>
His last words as we parted were that he felt sure we
should never meet again. I said he had been wrong once
when he told me that he should not see me again, and I
hoped he was wrong now. He said no, he felt that he had
no more work to do for God on this earth, and that he
should never return from the Congo. Within a month he
was in upper Egypt.
</p>

<p>
It was characteristic of the man that scarcely any one in
Haifa knew who he was. Seeing a very handsome garden
belonging to a rich Syrian, near Acre, he strolled into it,
and was accosted by the proprietor, who asked him who he
was. He replied, “Gordon Pasha,” on which my Syrian
friend, who told me the story, laughed incredulously, and
politely showed him out. Gordon meekly departed without
attempting to insist on his identity. The proprietor told me
that he felt convinced that he was being imposed upon, because
Gordon, when spoken to in English, would answer in
bad Arabic, and because, when asked his name, he took
his card-case half out of his pocket, as though to give his
card, and then, on second thought, put it back again and
answered verbally. So my friend lost his chance of entertaining
an angel unawares, which he has never ceased to regret,
the more especially as his friends take a pleasure in
teasing him about it.
</p>

<p>
My last letter from Gordon is dated Khartoum, the 6th
of March. Now that he is gone, and his name has become
<span class="pageno target" title="280" id="page-280"></span>
a household word in almost all countries, and among
the professors of all religions, the few among the natives
who knew him here treasure up every trait of his marked
individuality, and are fond of narrating anecdotes, which
grow by repetition. His instinct of retirement and extremely
unassuming manner concealed him, so to speak,
from general observation; but his simplicity, purity, and
absolute singleness of aim made him a sort of moral magnet,
irresistibly attractive to those who came directly beneath
the sphere of his influence. The potency of his virtue in
life has been proved by the imperishable moral legacy which
in death he has bequeathed to humanity.

<a href="#toc-53">THE CONVENT OF CARMEL <i>versus</i> THE TOWN OF
HAIFA.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, May 25.—It was from Carmel that in times of old
a small cloud was seen rising not bigger than a man's hand,
which overcast the heavens, and it is not impossible that a
political incident which has just occurred here may prove
the diplomatic commencement of a storm of another kind
pregnant with untold issues. If we look back through history
at the origin of some of its greatest events, we often
almost fail to discover them, on account of their insignificance.
When the moral atmosphere is charged with electricity,
it needs but a spark to produce the shock; and so it
is just possible that the upsetting of a few stones, on a barren
hillside, may open up a question which may assume proportions
of very considerable magnitude, as it involves the
most dangerous of all elements in a dispute, that of religious
fanaticism. The Monastery of Carmel, as your readers are
doubtless aware, is situated on the spur of the mountain
which projects in a point at an elevation of about five hundred
feet above the sea. From this point the mountain gradually
rises until it attains a height of about nine hundred
feet, immediately behind the town of Haifa and the German
colony. The mountain here spreads into an elevated plateau
of some extent, affording extensive pasture-ground and good
arable and vineyard land. For some years past the claim
of the convent over a large area of this plateau has been a
matter of dispute, but it only reached an acute stage the
other day, when the towns-people were called upon to pay
taxes on it. They naturally objected that they ought not to
pay taxes on land the use of which they did not enjoy, and
access to which was forbidden to them by a wall which had
been built by the convent as the boundary to its possessions.
In order to bring the matter to an issue, some thirty of the
<span class="pageno target" title="282" id="page-282"></span>
German colonists and as many of the Moslem inhabitants of
the town went up in a body and proceeded <i>vi et armis</i> to
tear down the wall. While thus engaged some of the monks
emerged, armed with spiritual weapons alone. One of them,
elevating his cross, pronounced a solemn curse, first in German
and then in Arabic, upon the profaners of their sacred
soil. The convent being under the protection of the French
government, a formal complaint was lodged against the action
of the Germans in the matter, and a deputation, consisting
of the German and French vice-consuls, were sent
down from Beyrout to inquire into it. Meantime the Turkish
government interfered, as it had a right to do, seeing
that many Ottoman subjects had participated in the act complained
of, and decided that the right of the convent to
erect the wall was a matter for the local tribunals to decide
upon, as well as the question of the validity of their title to
the part of the mountain claimed by them. In the meantime
instructions were given that, pending the decision of
the court, the wall should be replaced in exactly the same
position, and of the same dimensions, as before its removal.
Advantage was taken of this order to rebuild the wall much
more solidly, and to increase its height far beyond the limits
prescribed in the order, and the result was the removal of
the local governor for negligence in not seeing that the instructions
were properly carried out. Meantime the town
instituted a lawsuit against the convent, calling upon them
to substantiate their legal title to the land.
</p>

<p>
Now, one third of the population of Haifa is Moslem and
Jews, and about two thirds are Christian. The Christians
are all under the direct influence of the convent, and the
spirit of religious fanaticism runs high on both sides. On
measurement being made of the land claimed by the convent
it was found to amount to an area of about twelve square
miles. According to Turkish law the whole of this would
originally belong to the inhabitants of the town for their
common use, unless the town council had at some time or
other legally parted with it for an adequate consideration.
This it was denied on the part of the municipality that they
had ever done, and search was consequently made in the
records for the act of sale, which would have been registered.
<span class="pageno target" title="283" id="page-283"></span>
On the other hand, the monks had a duly-signed document
under which they claimed, but which, on further investigation,
was found to be practically a fraud, as none of the formalities
had been complied with, and the seal had been
affixed illegally by an officer who had been induced for a
certain consideration to perform the act. It is not contended
that the monks were a party to this irregularity. They seem,
indeed, rather to have been the victims of their agent at the
time, who perpetrated it, leaving them under the delusion
that they possessed a valid title, but the discovery left the
court no alternative but to pronounce judgment against
them. Against this judgment they have appealed to Constantinople,
and it would be difficult to see how it could be
reversed, were it not that the interests involved are of such
a peculiar character that the purely legal side of the question
may be overlooked.
</p>

<p>
The prestige which the order of barefooted Carmelites enjoys
in all Catholic countries is so great that the most powerful
influences will be invoked, and possibly not invoked in
vain, in their favor. Strong articles have already appeared
on the subject in the Continental press of Europe. The
Emperor of Austria has, I understand, been personally appealed
to, while the pilgrims, who, to the number of about
four hundred, have already visited the sacred shrine this
year, are every one of them missionaries who will be so many
Peter the Hermits, invoking once more the faith of the true
believer to protect the sacred mountain from the grasp of
the infidel. But there is an element in the affair which removes
it from the simple category of Cross <i>versus</i> Crescent,
and that is, that the interests of some three hundred Germans
are involved. As forming part of the population of Haifa,
they enjoy equal rights with the rest of the towns-people, and
Prince Bismarck is not a man to see their rights tamely
abandoned to the monks. It is true that the question is one
which affects exclusively the Turkish government, and there
can be no doubt that it would not willingly deprive an Ottoman
population of twelve square miles of mountain if they
are legally entitled to it, but the united pressure of Catholic
Europe might be too powerful a force for the Porte to resist
single-handed. It is a different matter when they have the
<span class="pageno target" title="284" id="page-284"></span>
German government at their back, and this quarrel over a
right of way and a patch of hillside may yet be pregnant
with important consequences. Had the convent entered
upon large agricultural operations, their rights over land
thus brought into cultivation could not be disputed. The
complaint of the population is that they neither cultivate it
themselves, nor allow others to cultivate it, or even to graze
their flocks upon it. The exclusive possession thus claimed
has deprived the German colonists of one of the most important
desiderata for the success of their colony.
</p>

<p>
A retreat from the heats of summer is almost essential to
the health of the colonists. If they had the right of way
claimed they could, with ease, construct a wagon-road to the
top of the hill overhanging the colony, where, at an elevation
of nine hundred feet, they would be in full enjoyment
of the sea breezes, while only half an hour distant from their
homes. The money necessary for the construction of such
a sanitarium was provided under singular circumstances a
few weeks ago. I was riding just outside the town, on the
Nazareth road, when to my surprise I met a foreign lady
riding by herself, accompanied only by an Arab, an unusual
sight in this country. Following her was a covered litter.
On returning to the colony an hour later I found that the
litter contained the body of the husband of the lady I had
met. He had died in it on the road from Nazareth a couple
of hours before I met the poor widow, a perfect stranger and
unable to speak a word of the language, forming the solitary
attendant of her husband's corpse. These painful circumstances
enlisted the warmest sympathy on the part of the
colonists, whose kindness and consideration so overwhelmed
the lady, who was herself a countrywoman, that before leaving
she presented the colony with a check for $7500. These
simple people had no idea when they were lavishing their
kindness on the widow that she was a lady of large fortune,
and this was their unexpected reward. And it is with this
money they hope to build their sanitarium.

<a href="#toc-54">PROGRESS EVEN IN PALESTINE.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, June 7.—I was glad to avail myself of an opportunity
to revisit Jerusalem after an interval of six years,
and by a journey through a part of Judea to see the changes
within that period. The attention which has of recent years
been directed towards Palestine has perhaps produced more
marked results in this province than in Galilee, and in some
respects its progress has been more rapid. This is partly
owing to the fact that for the past eight years it has been
under the administration of a more than usually enlightened
pasha, who exercises his authority independently of the
Governor-General of Syria, and partly because its holy
places prove more attractive both to Jews and Gentiles than
do those of Galilee. Hence there has been a larger inflow
of capital and of immigration.
</p>

<p>
Three miles from Jaffa lies the German colony of Sarona,
which, like the one at Haifa, was founded some years ago by
the Temple Society. It resembles the one there in the character
of its buildings and general plan. There is a wide
central street with neat stone and tiled roofed houses, and
two rows of shade trees, with a short cross street, church, and
schoolhouse, and that general air of cleanliness and comfort
which Germans understand so well how to impart to their
settlements. It is far inferior to Haifa, however, both on the
score of salubrity and beauty of position, being situated on
a grassy, rolling country destitute of woods, some miles from
the sea and the mountains. There is therefore something
forlorn in the solitude of its position. The inhabitants suffer
a good deal from fever, and many deaths took place last
year, which was unusually unhealthy. On the other hand,
the fertility of the soil and its proximity to so large and
prosperous a town as Jaffa, which now numbers close upon
twenty thousand inhabitants, enables the settlers to do
<span class="pageno target" title="286" id="page-286"></span>
somewhat better financially than those at Haifa. They are
engaged in extending the area of their orange-groves and
vineyards; and as the general experience is that the climate
of this country improves under the influence of husbandry,
it is to be hoped that a few more years will work a change
in this respect, as they certainly must in the general attractiveness
of the place. The Temple Society has also a small
colony actually in the suburbs of Jaffa, the members of which
are engaged in commercial pursuits in that town, and are
doing well.
</p>

<p>
Since I last visited this place emigrant Jews from Russia
and Roumania have established no fewer than four colonies
in its neighbourhood, which, however, are scattered in different
directions at distances of several miles apart. The
circumstances under which my journey was made prevented
me, unfortunately, from inspecting them as thoroughly as I
could have desired. Two of these are under the protection
of Baron Rothschild, and enjoy such pecuniary support from
him as will secure their future, in spite of the obstacles
which, owing to government opposition and other local
difficulties, they have had to encounter. So far as energy,
industry, and aptitude for agricultural pursuits are concerned,
the absence of which has always been alleged as the
reason why no Jewish colony could succeed, the experience
of more than two years has now proved that such apprehensions
are groundless, and that with a fair chance Jews make
very good colonists, and are likely, in fact, to succeed better
in this country as agriculturists than in America, where they
have the skilled industry and indomitable energy of the
American farmer to compete with, instead of the helpless
ignorance and ingrained indolence of the native fellahin,
who are their only rivals here.
</p>

<p>
Besides these two colonies there are two others, one of
which has been struggling on unaided for the last seven years,
and which has latterly almost succumbed to the methods which
have been resorted to by the government to extinguish it,
but which has within the last month derived fresh aid and
encouragement from the visit of Dr. Adler, the Grand Rabbi
of London, and Mr. Wissotsky, the delegate of a society
which has recently been formed in Poland, called “The
<span class="pageno target" title="287" id="page-287"></span>
Lovers of Israel.” The visit of these two gentlemen marks
a new era in the fortunes of the Petach Tikveh colony, as it
is called, as it resulted in the substantial donation of a sum
of £300, and in bringing it to the knowledge of the public.
One of the chief drawbacks of the colony has been the unhealthiness
of its site, and the purchase of a healthy hill-top,
about half an hour distant, has been attended with so much
difficulty that it is only now that the colonists have at last
secured their title to it sufficiently to warrant the building
of houses upon it.
</p>

<p>
Besides these four Jewish and two German colonies there
has been for fifteen years established in the neighbourhood
of Jaffa a large Jewish agricultural college, which was
founded by the Israelite Alliance, for the purpose of educating
Jewish youths in agricultural pursuits. It is a handsome
and extensive building, standing a little to the right of
the road from Jaffa to Jerusalem, amid groves of trees and
gardens, and surrounded by a fine tract of arable land.
Here are avenues of eucalypti and of bamboos, both trees
unknown in this country, and which, from their novelty, form
a striking feature in the plantations near the house. For
many years this establishment was a source of permanent expense
to its founders, and it was feared that the results
would never justify the original outlay. Their perseverance
has, however, met with its reward. The increase of the annual
income last year amounted to $5000. One of the principal
sources of revenue are the ethrogim, or gigantic citrons,
which are used by the Jews all over Europe at some of their
religious festivals, and which, if they can be guaranteed as
coming from the Holy Land, command a fictitious price.
Besides these they export oranges and vegetables, and have
engaged in the manufacture of wines and brandy, for which
they find a good sale. It is to be hoped that as Jewish
colonies in Palestine increase, and the demand for skilled
Jewish agriculturists conversant with the local methods of
cultivation and familiar with the language is augmented, a
better opening will be found for the youths who have received
their education in this establishment. Hitherto the
young men, after receiving a good education, of which agricultural
science only formed part, have generally seen their
<span class="pageno target" title="288" id="page-288"></span>
way on leaving the college to engage in some more profitable
and congenial pursuits than tilling the land. As a rule,
middle-aged men with a limited education and large families
make better agriculturists than ambitious and well-educated
youths.
</p>

<p>
There is a fifth colony in Judea, which is nearer to Jerusalem
than Jaffa, formed of Jews who have apparently been
hired to become Christians, by being provided for as colonists;
but so far it has proved a failure. The government has refused
all permission to build. They are at present living in
a large wooden shanty, and are said to be reverting to their
old faith, as they find that the new one does not pay.
</p>

<p>
I have also heard of a sixth colony which is in process of
formation, so that adding to these three which are in Galilee,
there are altogether nine Jewish colonies now in Palestine—
all of which, with one exception, have been established within
the last two years and a half, in spite of difficulties which
would have discouraged people animated by no higher sentiment
than that of merely finding a living. However slow
and uncertain their progress may be now, these first settlers
may console themselves by the reflection that their experience
as pioneers will be of incalculable value to their successors,
when altered conditions may arise, which shall offer
increased inducement to emigration.
</p>

<p>
Meantime, it is as well that intending immigrants should
not be misled by the delusive reports which are promulgated
from time to time of a change in the policy of the government
in this respect. Practically the opposition to Jewish
colonization on the part of the authorities is as stringent
as ever, and any action taken upon a contrary hypothesis
will only lead to disappointment.
</p>

<p>
This increasing tendency to flock into the Holy Land is
not confined, however, to Jews alone. There is an annual
augmentation in the number of pilgrims who invade it, of
nearly all the Christian sects, besides those who establish
themselves here under the influence of various religious hobbies.
Thus the foreign and Jewish population of this province
is constantly increasing, and the effect of this influx is
more strikingly marked at Jerusalem than elsewhere; but it
is natural that Jaffa, as the port of Judea, should also largely
<span class="pageno target" title="289" id="page-289"></span>
have benefited by its influence, and I was much struck by
the growth of the place and the signs of its increasing prosperity.
This is, no doubt, due also in some measure to the
excellent carriage-road which now connects it with Jerusalem.
I saw several large gangs of men at work upon those
sections which still remain of the old rough track, which in
former days made the journey between these places upon
wheels a positive torture. It is true that many excruciatingly
rough places still remain, but another year will remove
them, and it is the intention of the present governor to extend
the road from Jerusalem by way of Bethlehem (it is
now almost completed to the latter place) to Hebron, and
also to connect the rich country east of the Jordan with
Judea by a carriage-road which is in immediate contemplation
from Jerusalem to Jericho.
</p>

<p>
The rapidly improving facilities for travelling in Palestine,
the annual increase in the number of tourists who each
year visit it, the numerous ecclesiastical and charitable establishments
which have been already constructed and are
yearly extended, the influx of foreign capital resulting therefrom,
and the increase of the foreign population, both Jew
and Christian, all tend to give Palestine an exceptional position
as a province in the Turkish empire. It is the only one,
indeed, where the evidences of progress are steady and substantial;
and there can be no doubt that one of the most
marked results of this progress will be the importance which
the Holy Land is destined to assume in the event of the
Eastern question being reopened, for there is no province in
the empire upon which political and religious interests of so
varied and universal a nature are concentrated.

<a href="#toc-55">THE RECENT DISCOVERY OF GEZER.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Jerusalem</span>, June 23.—I was much struck on my way from
Jaffa to this place the other day by contrasting the different
systems which are resorted to by the varied races of foreigners
who are invading Palestine. There is the Jew, with
curling ear-locks and greasy gaberdine, and wallet slung
over his shoulder, trudging painfully along the dusty road.
He has had hard work to slip into the country at all, and has
only succeeded probably by means of backshish and a false
passport. He has undergone discomfort and privations innumerable
to win the privilege, which, to judge by his wan
and sickly face, is not likely long to be denied him, of dying
in Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
As he plods on, leaning wearily on his long staff, he is almost
run over by a bright yellow barouche dashing along
the road, with four horses, in a style which shows how rapidly
Western civilization is striding into the East. It is an English
duke “doing” Palestine. He is followed by a motley
group of his own country men and women, mounted on horses
and donkeys, the women for the most part apparently old
maids in straw hats, green spectacles, and veils, while a large
proportion of the men are evidently parsons, who wear clerical
coats and waistcoats and unclerical pith hats and jack
boots. The whole party, consisting of about thirty persons,
white with dust, are preceded by an elaborately attired
dragoman, whom they are about to follow over the country
like a flock of sheep, for they are the last batch of the season
of Cook's tourists.
</p>

<p>
But they were not to be compared for picturesqueness or
singularity of appearance with the next <i>cortège</i> which I
overtook, and the aspect of which, from a distance, puzzled
me excessively. There appeared in front of me a large object
of some sort, which was being slowly dragged along by
<span class="pageno target" title="291" id="page-291"></span>
a crowd of people who were evidently not natives of the
country. On reaching it I found that it was a huge bell,
weighing seven or eight tons, most elaborately ornamented
with scriptural and sacred designs in <i>basso-rilievo</i>, and which,
placed on a truck with low wheels, was being hauled by
about eighty Russian peasants, more than half of whom
were women. Looking on this singular group of rugged-featured
people, with their light hair and Kalmuck countenances,
one felt suddenly transported from the hills of
Palestine to the Steppes of Southern Russia. The men wore
high boots, baggy trousers, long full-skirted coats, tight at
the waist, and flat caps, and the women the sombre and dowdy
habiliments common to the Russian peasant class. They
were all yoked by the breast with ropes to the truck, tugging
it slowly but cheerfully along, and when I stopped and
tried to stammer out the few words of Russian which I still
remembered, they greeted my attempts with loud shouts of
laughter, and made explanations which my knowledge of the
language was too limited to enable me to comprehend. But
my curiosity was destined to be satisfied at a later period on
the arrival of this precious burden at Jerusalem. Meantime
I could not but regard with interest the eager devotion of
these poor people, and especially of the women, who were
thus satisfying a religious instinct by exercising the functions
of draught animals, and toiling up the road they
deemed so sacred to the holy city, which is invested with a
higher sanctity to the adherents of the Greek rite than to
those of any other Christian communion. I found afterwards
that it took them just a week to drag their bell up to Jerusalem,
many falling ill by the way, and one dying, and reinforcements
had to be sent from Jerusalem to assist them.
</p>

<p>
Had it not been for the various houses which have been
built for the accommodation of travellers the mortality
would probably have been greater, but the increase of travel
along this road has multiplied the number of rest-houses,
and there are now four or five of various degrees of excellence,
to say nothing of Greek and Catholic convents, more
or less far from the road, to which pilgrims can resort. The
new hotel which has just been put up by a German colonist
at Ramleh is among the most conspicuous of these improvements;
<span class="pageno target" title="292" id="page-292"></span>
and here, as the place is one of some archæological
interest, and I thought the enterprise of my host deserved to
be encouraged, I stayed to pass the night.
</p>

<p>
In the centuries immediately subsequent to the crusades,
Ramleh is often mentioned by the old chroniclers, for it was
then, as now, a favorite resting-place for travellers and pilgrims
on their way between Jaffa and Jerusalem. But it
gradually fell into decay, and three hundred years ago, when
the traveller Belon was there, he found it almost deserted,
scarcely twelve houses being inhabited, and the fields mostly
untilled. It is now one of the most go-ahead places in
Palestine, containing a population of at least five thousand,
and is surrounded by extensive gardens and olive groves,
above which the lofty tower erected by the Sultan Bibars,
in the thirteenth century, conspicuously rears its graceful
proportions.
</p>

<p>
By far the most interesting spot, however, in the whole of
this section of country lies about two miles to the right of
the road from Ramleh to Jerusalem, an hour after leaving
the former place, which places it as much out of the track
of tourists as if it were a day's journey. It is a mound called
Tell el-Gezer, at the village of Abu Shusheh. This village is
the property of a Mr. Bergheim, a Jew banker of Jerusalem,
who owns an estate here of about five thousand acres, from
which I may say, <i>en passant</i>, that he derives a very large
revenue.<a id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Apart from the interest of the fact of a Jew being
so large a landed proprietor in Palestine, Abu Shusheh
has claims upon our notice which have only recently been
discovered, and which to those who have been bitten with
the enthusiasm of elucidating the ancient topography of
Palestine, and identifying its antique sites, is replete with
the highest importance.
</p>

<p>
Among those who have devoted themselves to the study
of Palestine geography and antiquarian research the French
savant Monsieur Clermont Ganneau ranks second to none.
One of the problems which has for many years excited the
interest and curiosity of Palestine explorers was the whereabouts
<span class="pageno target" title="293" id="page-293"></span>
of the ancient city of Gezer. We gather from the
Biblical record that this was an important town prior to the
arrival and settlement of the Israelites in the country. In
the book of Joshua it is classed among the royal cities of
Canaan. Its king, Horam, was defeated by Joshua while attempting
to relieve Lachish, which was besieged by the Israelites.
Later it was included in the territory of the tribe
of Ephraim, and assigned to the Levitical family of Kohath.
It is mentioned several times during the wars between David
and the Philistines, and during Solomon's reign one of the
Pharaohs made an expedition against it, which resulted in
the capture and burning of the town. It afterwards became
part of the dowry of Pharaoh's daughter when she became
Solomon's wife, and he rebuilt it. The last we hear of it
was in the wars of the Maccabees, when it reappears under
the name of Gazara. Taken by assault in the first instance
by the Jews, it passed successively into the hands of the two
contending parties, who attached equal importance to its
possession. John Hyrcanus, the Jewish commander, made
it his military residence.
</p>

<p>
It was during his study of the old Arab geographers that
M. Clermont Ganneau came upon the name Tell el-Gezer, and
finding that it met all the topographical requirements of
the Bible, he went in search of it at Abu Shusheh. Here he
found that a mound on Mr. Bergheim's property was known
to the natives by that name, though it was too insignificant
ever to have figured on any map. On making minute investigation,
he discovered, to his delight, a bilingual inscription;
the first word, in Greek characters of the classical epoch,
was the name of a man, “Alkio,” immediately followed by
Hebrew letters of ancient square form, the translation of
which was “limit of Gezer.” This settled the question, and
the English Palestine Exploration Fund at once sent a special
mission to verify Monsieur Ganneau's discoveries. This
they did most completely, finding four other inscriptions,
besides making a most complete survey of the place. As is
not uncommon with such very ancient remains, the first aspect
of the spot is disappointing. There are, in fact, no
ruins visible, with the exception of a few terraces on the
Tell, consisting of large blocks of unhewn stone. The Tell
<span class="pageno target" title="294" id="page-294"></span>
itself, on which part of the city appears to have stood, is a
sort of ridge about six hundred yards long, one hundred
across, and two hundred and fifty feet above the surrounding
rocky valleys. The foundations of the ancient houses
may be traced possibly in the numerous rock-cuttings with
which the place abounds, but it is difficult to distinguish
them from cuttings for quarrying stone on the old method,
and certainly many of the cuttings were those of quarriers.
There are the remains of what was apparently an old fortress
at the eastern end of the Tell, but the most remarkable
features are the numerous wine-presses, which number about
thirty, some of them in an excellent state of preservation.
There are also some tombs, but these are rare and scattered,
which is to be accounted for by the fact that this was a Levitical
city, within the limits of which no interment was allowed.
There are numerous chips of stone, some apparently
basaltic, and much broken pottery all over the Tell, and
many flints, some of which were worked, have been discovered.
While he was building his house, which is just under
the Tell, Mr. Bergheim found a deep cistern about forty feet
square, lined with small stones and covered with two coats
of cement, which was hard and white; the walls were about
two feet thick, and it seemed to have a niche in its eastern
wall, as though it had at one time been used as a chapel. In
the niche a cross was found, painted red, and beneath it a
stone altar, which has been removed; but all this points to
an early Christian occupation. Mr. Bergheim has since converted
the cistern to its original use. He also found a
curious idol in hard red pottery. The fellahin say that
many of these “dolls,” as they call them, used to be picked
up, and were given to the children as playthings. Flint instruments,
earthenware weights, and rubbers in composition,
for use in cementing cisterns, have been found in ploughing
on the Tell, and near its southwest extremity a number of
skeletons were discovered, apparently of persons slain in battle;
one had a sword-cut on the skull. An aqueduct cut in
the rock is also traceable along the hillside.
</p>

<p>
Altogether the place is a good deal more interesting than
it looks at first sight, and had its owner been an antiquary
he would doubtless have had splendid opportunities of making
<span class="pageno target" title="295" id="page-295"></span>
a valuable collection. That the spot has always had a
semi-sacred character in the eyes of the country people is
evident from the traditions which attach to it. One is that
the city of Noah stood upon the hill here, and that the deluge
came from a place called Et Tannar, which is a cavity with
an old well on the east slope of the hill. The modern name
Abu Shusheh, or “Father of the Topknot,” is said to be derived
from a dervish who prayed for rain in time of drought,
and was told by a sand diviner that he would perish if it
came. The water came out of the earth and formed a pool,
into which he stepped and was drowned. The people, seeing
only his topknot left, cried, “Ya Abu Shusheh” (O Father
of the Topknot).
</p>

<p>
It is a pity that, with the exception of the one deciphered
by Monsieur Ganneau, the inscriptions are so much effaced
that, although certain characters can be made out, they have
hitherto defied translation. Some of them appear to approach
to the later Hebrew forms, while others bear some
resemblance to Cufic.
</p>

<p>
There are other sites of interest which lie more or less distant
from the road from Jaffa to Jerusalem, but I had not
time to visit them, though the comparatively more advanced
state of civilization of this province and the good accommodation
to be found on the road would facilitate the explorer's
task. On the other hand, the examination of this part of
the country has been so thorough that he cannot hope for
the rich rewards that are to be found in more inaccessible
districts.

<a href="#toc-56">TRADITIONAL SITES AT JERUSALEM.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, July 20.—It is a melancholy reflection, and one
by no means creditable to the Christianity which prevailed
in the fourth century after Christ, that the Jerusalem of
the present day, the Holy City of the world par excellence,
should contain within its walls more sacred shams and impostures
than any other city in the world. The responsibility
for the gross superstition which prevails in regard to
sites and localities mainly rests with the fourth century, and
chiefly with the Empress Helena, who was principally instrumental
in inventing them, and the Christian churches, especially
the Greek and Latin, find it in their interest to foster
these transparent frauds, for the enormous pecuniary advantages
which accrue from them.
</p>

<p>
The extraordinary amount of research and investigation
of which Jerusalem has been the subject during the last
twenty years, the extent of the excavations which have been
made, involving an expenditure of about $100,000, and the
conscientious impartiality and profound acquirements of the
explorers, have demolished the whole superstructure which
early and mediæval Christianity had reared upon the credulity
of its votaries; and which the churches of the present
day, despite all the evidences to the contrary, find it in their
interest to perpetuate. Thus it has now been proved to
demonstration that, wherever the tomb in which Christ was
laid after his crucifixion may have been, it could not have
been in the cave over which the gorgeous edifice called the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre now stands; for we now
know by recent examination the position of the walls which
enclosed the city in the time of Christ, though some still
deny the correctness of the latest conclusions which have
been arrived at. We also know that Calvary, or Golgotha,
where he was crucified, was “nigh at hand” to the sepulchre;
that Golgotha was “nigh to the city,” and not in it,
<span class="pageno target" title="297" id="page-297"></span>
and that Jesus “suffered without the gate,” and that all
tombs, saving those of David and Huldah and eight Jewish
kings, were without the walls, while the cave over which the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre is built is within them. As,
however, even the churches do not go so far as to maintain
that any tradition had been preserved among Christians during
the first three centuries after the death of Christ of his
place of burial, they have had to resort to inspiration as the
means of its discovery. Some of the early writers maintain
that it was the Emperor Constantine himself who was divinely
inspired to find it; others that it was his mother, the Empress
Helena. This is a trifling discrepancy. Whichever
it was, the fact of the inspiration remains, and scientific
investigation has, ever since the days of Galileo, been bound
to give way before ecclesiastical inspiration and infallibility.
So, no matter whatever evidences exist to the contrary,
crowds of pilgrims will continue to crawl over those sanctified
stones, wearing them hollow with their kisses, as long
as the sacerdotal organization of which it is the representative
remains to impose upon them its authority.
</p>

<p>
With considerate ingenuity, and possibly with a view to
lightening the labors of the pilgrims as much as possible,
the early Church crowded as many sacred stones together
under the roof of the holy edifice it could with decency.
Thus we have the Stone of Unction, on which Christ's body
was laid for anointing, but it was getting so worn that the
real stone lies below the marble slab, which, however, answers
the purpose for the pilgrims. Close by is the Circular
Stone, where the Virgin stood while the body was being
anointed; also the stone on which Jesus stood when he
appeared to Mary Magdalene, and the stone on which she
stood, and the column to which he was bound when scourged;
and your devout guide will show you, if you have the patience
to attend to him, the exact place where Jesus was
stripped by the soldiers, the place where the purple robe
was put on him, the place where the soldiers cast lots for
his raiment, the rent in the rock made by the earthquake,
the place where his body was wrapped in linen cloths, the
place where he indicated with his own hand the centre of
the world, and so on, <i>ad nauseam</i>.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="298" id="page-298"></span>
</div>

<p>
Sometimes another Church commits a burglary and steals
some of these stones. The Armenians have been especially
guilty in this respect. They have stolen from the holy sepulchre
the stone on which the angel sat, that had been rolled
away from the door of the sepulchre, which they now display
in the chapel of the Palace of Caiaphas; also a piece of
the true cross, which was originally discovered under inspiration
by Helena, as well as that of the penitent thief, who is
now canonized under the name of Dimas. I don't know
what authority they have for calling him Dimas, whose
reputed birthplace is, for political reasons, going to be converted
into another holy place. There is something rather
appropriate in the idea of the power that is waiting for a
chance to despoil the Turkish empire of Syria erecting a
shrine in worship of the penitent thief.
</p>

<p>
The most remarkable sites are those which illustrate the
parables. Thus, pilgrims are shown the window which was
the post of observation of Dives, and the stone, now worn
by the kisses of the faithful, where Lazarus sat when the
dog licked his sores. I asked my guide where the dog was,
but he said he was dead, and added, with a smile, “I don't
believe any of these things.”
</p>

<p>
I asked him why not.
</p>

<p>
“Oh,” he replied, “I'm a Jew.”
</p>

<p>
After that the glibness with which he pattered off all the
Christian traditions was very edifying until my patience was
exhausted, and I said, “Well, supposing, as we neither of
us believe in any of these invented sites, we go and try and
find something that is real.”
</p>

<p>
He had been in the service of some of the recent Jerusalem
explorers, and I afterwards found him an intelligent
companion.
</p>

<p>
It is a striking illustration of Moslem religious toleration,
as compared with that shown by Christians in Jerusalem
towards Jews, that while this man could accompany me into
the Mosque of Omar, that most beautiful and sacred of Mohammedan
temples, he was not allowed even to enter the
street in which stands the Christian Church of the Holy
Sepulchre.
</p>

<p>
So far as Christian rites are concerned, it may, then, be
<span class="pageno target" title="299" id="page-299"></span>
taken as a fact that the interest which attaches to Jerusalem
has but a very slender relation to them. The great natural
features, of course, must always remain. Bethlehem, Bethany,
and the Mount of Olives are as they ever were, but
there are two Gardens of Gethsemane, one claimed by the
Latins and one by the Greeks. When we descend to more
minute details they are either purely mythical or at best
only matters of vague conjecture. One of the best illustrations
of the purely mythical is Christ's footprint on the rock
from which he ascended into heaven, which is a good deal
smaller than that of Buddha, which I have also seen on the
top of Adam's Peak in Ceylon, or of Jethro, which the
Druses showed me in the Neby Schaib.
</p>

<p>
Among those open to conjecture, the position of Calvary
and the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea are points upon which
research may still throw light. Every indication goes to
show that Golgotha, or Calvary, was a knoll outside the Damascus
gate, exactly in the opposite direction to that affixed
by Christian tradition, and which would do away with the
Via Dolorosa as a sacred thoroughfare, the street shown as
that along which Christ bore his cross on his way to execution.
It is only probable that Calvary was the ordinary
execution ground of Jerusalem, which is called in the Talmud
“the House of Stoning” about <span class="sc small">A.D.</span> 150, and which
current tradition among the Jews identifies with this knoll,
a tradition borne out by the account of it contained in the
Mishnah, or text of the Talmud, which describes a cliff
over which the condemned was thrown by the first witness.
If he was not killed by the fall, the second witness cast a
stone on him, and the crowd on the cliff or beneath it completed
his execution. It was outside the gate, at some distance
from the Judgment Hall. The knoll in question is
just outside the gate, with a cliff about fifty feet high.
Moreover, we are informed that sometimes “they sunk a
beam in the ground, and a crossbeam extended from it, and
they bound his hands, one over the other, and hung him
up.” (Sanhedrim vi. 4.) Thus the House of Stoning was
a recognized place of crucifixion. It is curious that an early
Christian tradition pointed to this site as the place of stoning
of Stephen, the proto-martyr. The vicinity has apparently
<span class="pageno target" title="300" id="page-300"></span>
always been considered unlucky. An Arab writer in
the Middle Ages pronounces a barren tract adjoining accursed
and haunted, so that the traveller should not pass
it at night.
</p>

<p>
The Valley of Judgment (or Jehosaphat), which the Arab
calls the Valley of Hell, passes not far east of the knoll,
the Arab name of which is Heirimayeh, probably from a
cave in the knoll called Jeremiah's grotto. The idea that
this was in fact the Place of the Skull was warmly adopted
by the late heroic defender of Khartoum, General Gordon,
who spent the year before he went on his fatal mission to
the Soudan in investigating points bearing on these subjects
as tending to uphold theories which he held in regard to
them, and which he explained to me at great length. Before
leaving England he sent some notes on these to the
Palestine Exploration Fund, and in their last quarterly
statement these are published. They are full of pathetic
interest now. In regard to the Place of the Skull, General
Gordon says that “the mention of the Place of the Skull in
each of the four Gospels is a call to attention. Whenever a
mention of any particular is made frequently we may rely
there is something in it. If the skull is mentioned four times,
one naturally looks for the body, and if you take Warren's
or other contours, with the earth or rubbish removed, showing
the natural state of the land, you cannot help seeing
that there is a body, that the conduit (discovered by Shick)
is the œsophagus, that the quarries are the chest, and if
you are venturesome you will carry out the analogy further.
You find in the verse in the Psalms, ‘Zion on the sides of
the North,’ the word ‘pleura,’ the same as they ‘pierced his
pleuron, and there came forth blood and water.’ God took
a pleuron from the side of Adam and made woman. Now
the Church of Christ is made up of or came from his pleura.
The stones of the Temple came from the quarries, or chest
of the figure, and so on. So that fixed the figure of the
body to the skull.”
</p>

<p>
This theory led to Gordon's forming a singular and mystical
conception of the emblematic character of the city as
typifying in actual configuration the New Jerusalem, the
divine bride.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="301" id="page-301"></span>
</div>

<p>
The most interesting fact, however, in connection with
this knoll is the recent discovery upon it of a tomb, which
has excited considerable interest as being, from its position,
more likely to be the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, in which
never man had been laid before Christ, than any hitherto
known. From the knowledge we have now acquired of
rock-cut tombs in Palestine we are able to judge from its
appearance and construction its probable date, and these all
go to prove that it belongs to the later Jewish period, or
that which terminated with the destruction of Jerusalem.
The appearance of this tomb so near the old place of execution,
and so far from the other tombs in the old cemeteries
of the city, is very remarkable. A careful plan of
the site and tomb has been made by Lieutenant Mantell,
R. E., and sent to England, where the subject has lately
afforded matter for discussion. The reason why the tomb
was not found by the early Christians in their search for
it at the time of Constantine is easy to be accounted for
by the fact that, about ten years after the crucifixion, the
“Women's Towers” were built by Agrippa upon the rock
over the tomb, and it must have been hidden beneath or
within the new building. Under these circumstances the
sepulchre could no longer be visited, and in course of time
its existence was forgotten, until the Empress Helena destroyed
the temple to Venus which the Romans had built
on the present site of the Holy Sepulchre Church, and “beyond
all hope” (as Eusebius words it), discovered the rock-cut
Jewish tomb, which the faithful accepted as the tomb
of Christ.
</p>

<p>
A peculiar interest does nevertheless attach to these extremely
ancient tombs in the Holy Sepulchre Church, one
of which is now appropriated to Nicodemus, the nature of
which I will discuss in my next letter. It is extremely
probable that either Constantine or Helena heard that
tombs of a high sanctity stood beneath the Venus temple,
and they thought they could not do better than take
the most sacred tomb to which tradition of any sort attached,
and call it the holy sepulchre. Modern iconoclasticism
and love of truth have, however, proved too strong
for fourteen hundred years of unfounded tradition. If the
<span class="pageno target" title="302" id="page-302"></span>
churches had only taken half as much trouble to preserve
the moral truths which are to be found in the teachings
of Christ, as they have to preserve a cave in which he was
never buried, the world would have been so much the better
instead of so much the worse for their exertions.

<a href="#toc-57">TRADITIONAL SITES AT JERUSALEM—<i>Continued</i>.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, August 3.—The discoveries which have been made
in Jerusalem during the last few years, and the conclusions
at which those who have most deeply studied the subject
have arrived in consequence, render it extremely desirable
that a new or revised description of the Holy City should
be inserted in the tourists' hand-books for Syria and Palestine.
Travellers should be warned against dragomans who
waste their time taking them to see Christian sites which
have no relation to the facts they are supposed to commemorate,
and possess no interest of any kind beyond the philosophical
one that they illustrate the extraordinary credulity
and superstitions which exist among the professors of Christianity
in the nineteenth century, and which are certainly
not exceeded, even if they are paralleled, by those of any
heathen religion.
</p>

<p>
A Jerusalem hand-book, to be of any interest, should deal
with the conclusions resulting from the excavations and researches
of Sir Charles Wilson, Sir Charles Warren, Captain
Condor, M. Clermont Ganneau, and others, during the last
twenty years, and leave the traditions of the Latin and
Greek churches almost out of the question altogether.
Their researches have settled nearly all the topographical
questions connected with ancient Jerusalem, which had previously
been the subject of so much controversy and error,
the doubts and difficulties connected with them arising from
the fact that the city had been more or less destroyed and
built over so many times that the original foundations of its
walls and Temple could only be determined by extensive and
laborious excavations; and in the course of these many collateral
discoveries were made.
</p>

<p>
We learn from the publications of the Palestine Exploration
<span class="pageno target" title="304" id="page-304"></span>
Fund that these excavations were carried on under difficulties
of every kind, in face of the opposition of the local
government and in spite of continued fevers and lack of
funds. The mines were driven to extraordinary depths; one
at the southeast angle of the Haram being eighty feet deep,
and another, near the northeast angle, being one hundred
and twenty feet beneath the surface, where it reaches the
solid rock. In consequence of the great depths, the scarcity
of the mining frames, and the treacherous character of the
débris through which the shafts and galleries were driven,
the work was one of unusual danger and difficulty, requiring
much courage and determination. Sir Charles Warren and
the non-commissioned officers of his staff worked constantly
with their lives in their hands, and often undertook operations
from which the native workmen recoiled. The prudence
and discipline of the party, however, secured valuable
discoveries without an accident; and it is generally acknowledged
that the results are of an importance which fully repays
the labor and difficulty of the operations.
</p>

<p>
Sir Charles Warren was the officer who so courageously
entered the desert of Sinai after the late Egyptian war, when
he succeeded in capturing the murderers of Professor Palmer,
Captain Gill, and Lieutenant Sharrington, and bringing
them to justice. The result of his labors in Jerusalem, and
that of his fellow-explorers, is a magnificent atlas, published
last year by the Palestine Exploration Fund, containing a
most elaborate series of maps, plans, elevations, and engravings,
which reproduce the sacred city in all its most striking
features, accompanied by a handsome volume of descriptive
matter. We are thus able to base an account of the ancient
topography of the city on data more exact than any previously
acquired, and to read the ancient historic accounts
by the light of ascertained facts, instead of guessing at
probabilities by the aid of descriptions, which, however carefully
written, are still, as all descriptions must be, vague
where the student requires most exactitude, and deficient
where he most wishes for details.
</p>

<p>
With the assistance of these publications a guide-book
might be compiled which would enable the tourist to order
his dragoman to take him straight to the places worth seeing,
<span class="pageno target" title="305" id="page-305"></span>
instead of—following on the track of exploded tradition—going
with him like a sheep to those that are not. Much
could be done to clear away existing confusion and prevent
the perpetuation of error by a change in the received nomenclature,
whereby things should be called by their right names
so far as they are known, instead of by misleading appellations,
derived from the records of early pilgrims or the later
crusaders. I will take a few examples as illustrations. Not
far from the Church of the Holy Sepulchre the guide shows
the traveller an immense reservoir, now being filled up. This,
he says, is the Pool of Bethesda, but it has only been thus
designated since the fourteenth century. In the twelfth
this pool was supposed to be a cistern near the Church of
St. Anne, and in the fourth the site of Bethesda was shown
at the twin pools, northwest of Antonia. The fact is that
there are only two sites which may be regarded as possible
for Bethesda, one being the spring of En-Rogel, which has
an intermittent ebb and flow, and which is still frequented
by the Jews, who bathe in it to cure various diseases. The
other is the curious well immediately west of the Temple
enclosure, now called Hamman Esh-Shefa, or the Healing
Spring, a long reservoir reached by a shaft nearly one hundred
feet deep. None of the pools which have at various
times been selected by tradition have any supply of living
water, and none can well be supposed to have any intermittent
rise and fall, such as we understand by the moving of
the waters.
</p>

<p>
Again, take the tombs of Absalom and St. James. There
is nothing whatever to connect the first with Absalom. The
singular style of its architecture shows that it cannot be the
pillar “Absalom reared up for himself during his lifetime in
the king's dale.” M. Clermont Ganneau has made excavations
uncovering the bases and pedestals of the columns, all
of which are purely Greek. Indeed, it is only since the
twelfth century that it was called the tomb of Absalom at
all. The author of the Jerusalem Itinerary calls it the tomb
of Hezekiah, and Adamanus, in the seventh century, calls it
the tomb of Jehoshaphat. It is possibly the monument of
Alexander Jannæus spoken of by Josephus. So, too, the
tomb of St. James has nothing to do with St. James; for
<span class="pageno target" title="306" id="page-306"></span>
there has lately been discovered on the façade an inscription
in square Hebrew in so inaccessible a position as to have
been only probably cut before the façade was completed,
which mentions that the family of the Beni Hezir are buried
there. This family of priests is mentioned in the Bible
(1 Chron. xxiv. 15). The inscription seems to date from
the first century before Christ.
</p>

<p>
The so-called tomb of David is a vault over which has
been built a room, called the chamber in which the Feast of
the Passover prior to the crucifixion is supposed to have
taken place. Close to it is the Palace of Caiaphas, and in it
is shown the spot where Peter stood when he denied his
Master. Near it is the rock upon which the cock roosted when
he crew. The “rock,” the “spot,” the “palace,” the “Cænaculum,”
and the “tomb” all rest upon equally invalid authority.
As regards the tomb of David, we know that it was
within the walls, together with those of eight other Jewish
kings. That the place was apparently well known as late as
the time of Christ we gather both from the Acts and
Josephus. It is remarkable that one undisputed Jewish
tomb still exists in such a position as to have been certainly
within the city of David. This is the so-called tomb of
Nicodemus, and it is yet more remarkable that in its original
condition, before it was partly destroyed, this tomb must
have been just made to contain nine bodies, placed in kokim,
or graves cut according to the oldest arrangement employed
by the Jews. Josephus mentions as a peculiarity of the
tombs of the kings that some of the coffins were buried beneath
the surface, so as to be unseen even to those standing
within the monument. Just such an arrangement exists in
the tomb under consideration, the floor of which is sunk so
that the graves on one side are on a lower tier. It seems,
therefore, quite possible that the Church of the Holy Sepulchre
preserves the monument of the nine chief kings of
Jerusalem. Of course, tradition, with its usual ignorance,
places “the tombs of the kings” on the hill of the upper
city, where your guide takes you to see them, and where
there are no ancient tombs at all, the tombs there being of
a date not earlier than the first century before Christ. A
fine sarcophagus, with an Aramaic inscription, stating that
<span class="pageno target" title="307" id="page-307"></span>
it held the body of a certain Queen Sara, was discovered in
them. Though called by a wrong name, they are, nevertheless,
well worth visiting. As it is supposed by some authorities
that Helena, Queen of Adiabene, was also buried
here, they might more properly be called the tombs of the
queens.
</p>

<p>
But the really great work which recent investigation has
accomplished has mainly reference, not so much to such details
as these, which must always remain more or less matters
of speculation, as to the settlement of controversies affecting
the topographical questions connected with ancient Jerusalem.
First, in regard to points upon which all are now
agreed. There is no doubt about the Mount of Olives and
the brook Kedron. It is agreed that the Temple stood on
the spur immediately west of the Kedron, and that the
southern tongue of this spur was called Ophel. It is also
agreed that the flat valley west of this spur is that to which
Josephus applies the name Tyropæan, though there was a
diversity as to the exact course of the valley, which has now
been set at rest by the collection of the rock levels within
the city. It is also agreed by all authorities that the high
southwestern hill, to which the name of Sion has been applied
since the fourth century, is that which Josephus calls
the upper city, or upper Market Place. The site of the
Pool of Siloam is also undisputed, and certain natural features
have been determined, which serve as data on which to
construct the walls of the ancient city and fix the site and
area of the Temple enclosure in the time of Herod. There
is still some controversy in regard to the exact position and
course of the city walls prior to its destruction by Titus, but
this is chiefly maintained by those who are fatally affected
in their religious sentiments. There is also a difference of
opinion in regard to the area of the Temple building. Practically,
however, this point has been settled by the great
weight of authority on one side, which affirms that the present
Haram enclosure, in which are situated the mosque of
Omar, and the sacred stone, represent the area of Herod's
Temple, only one or two standing out for a restriction of
this area. If the Turkish government would only allow explorations
to be made under the platform of the dome of the
<span class="pageno target" title="308" id="page-308"></span>
rock, the very rock upon which Abraham is supposed to have
been ordered to sacrifice Isaac, and if the examination of the
closed chambers known to exist on the north and east sides
of this platform could be carried out, the controversy might
be set at rest by actual discovery. Of the Temple of Solomon
little is known, though it is possible that the great
scarps in the present British cemetery may be as old as the
time of David, or the eleventh century before Christ. They
are, without doubt, the oldest existing remains in Jerusalem,
and formed part of the ramparts of the upper city. Meantime,
the most interesting spot which it contains, whether
for Jew, Christian, or Mohammedan, is that mysterious
dome of the rock, with its gorgeous mosque covering the
sacred stone, which Christ himself must have regarded with
as much veneration in his day as the adherents of the two
other religions, so widely opposed to the one of which he
was the founder, do now.

<a href="#toc-58">PROGRESS IN JERUSALEM.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, August 10.—There is probably no city in the dominions
of the sultan which has undergone more change during
the last few years than Jerusalem, and as any change
which implies progress, implies also the increase of foreign
influence, and is always viewed with suspicion by the Porte,
the march of events in Palestine is watched by Turkish
statesmen with a jealousy which finds its expression in a
persistent effort to oppose it. As, however, the basis of the
movement to which Jerusalem owes its increase during recent
years is a religious one, and is founded upon a sentiment
which proverbially thrives by opposition, all efforts to
retard the influx of population and capital into the Holy
City have proved unavailing. Owing to increased facilities
of travel, the pilgrimages both of the Greek and Latin
churches have been more numerous. A new feature is that
some of the richer pilgrims from time to time establish themselves
here. This is especially the case with the Russian
members of the Greek Church. The influx of Jews has also
been increasing to a remarkable extent. The Protestant
sects are constantly enlarging the field of their operations,
and new charitable and educational establishments are
springing up from year to year. An American society of
Second Adventists has been resident here for some years,
while isolated religious cranks find in the Holy City an appropriate
dwelling-place, for reasons known only to themselves.
</p>

<p>
The result of all this is that whereas when I was last
here, six years ago, only a very few houses had been built
on the Jaffa road outside the walls of the town, now there is
an extensive and constantly increasing Frank suburb. The
price of land has risen fifty per cent., and is still constantly
rising. New hotels and shops have been opened to meet
<span class="pageno target" title="310" id="page-310"></span>
the increasing demand. Within the last twenty years the
population of the Holy City has certainly doubled, the increase
consisting entirely of Jews and Christians. Apart
from its sacred associations the city has no attractions as a
residence of any kind, but quite the reverse. This fact possesses
a highly important political significance, because it is
evident that in the degree in which the vested interests of
rival sects and religions accumulate upon this spot <span id="itis">it is</span>
destined some day to become a bone of contention between
them. It is probably the only city in the world where the
same amount of capital and enterprise is expended on objects
which are in no sense remunerative, while in proportion to its
size there is none where a larger sum is annually given away,
either in the form of charitable or religious donations.
Nothing strikes one more than the proportion of buildings
having some sort of public character or other to private
dwellings, and these buildings are constantly increasing.
This year the estimated expenditure of the Greek and Latin
churches will be over $600,000 for building purposes alone.
The number of Russian pilgrims who visit Jerusalem annually
is about five thousand, and it is constantly increasing.
They are all accommodated in the extensive premises belonging
to the Russian government, in the centre of which
the Russian consulate is situated, and which forms a sort of
Russian suburb to the Holy City. Here one feels transported
for the time to the dominions of the czar, as he hears
on all sides the Slav tongue, and finds himself jostled by
men and women in the peasant costume of their own country,
chaffering over wares which the more enterprising of their
number have imported to sell to their own country people,
while they squat in stalls and booths which they have roughly
extemporized for the purpose.
</p>

<p>
When you consider the amount of foreign money which
is annually expended in Jerusalem by these hosts of pilgrims—those
of the Latin Church, however, do not equal in number
those of the Greek—by the tourists and general influx
of sightseers who flock here during Easter week, and by the
churches and societies in building operations, you cannot
wonder that many persons have of late years become wealthy,
and that many natives of Syria and the Levant are attracted
<span class="pageno target" title="311" id="page-311"></span>
to the town in the hope of becoming so. The tide having
thus set in, it goes on increasing, and the rivalry of the Latin
and Greek churches imparts, as it were, a stimulus to the
whole jumble of creeds and nationalities which cluster round
the sacred shrines.
</p>

<p>
Among the latest and most interesting arrivals are a number
of Jews from Yemen. Hitherto these little-known
people had only been heard of, or at most seen, by one or
two enterprising travellers who have penetrated from Aden
into the southern deserts of Arabia Felix. I was told that
they consider themselves as belonging to the tribe of Dan.
They have lately arrived as refugees in Jerusalem from
Yemen, where they have suffered great misery during the
recent wars between the Arab tribes which inhabit that province
and the Turkish troops. Finding themselves ultimately
reduced to starvation by the plunder of which they were the
victims from both sides, they determined to seek shelter in
the Holy City, where they arrived in rags in a starving and
destitute condition. They have since been provided for by
subscriptions among their co-religionists raised in Europe. I
met some of them one afternoon, down at the Place of Wailing,
and was much struck by the mild and gentle expression
of their countenances. They are reputed to be well versed
in their own religious lore, and to be devout without being
hypocritical, which is more than can be said for Palestinian
Jews generally. Although they were themselves engaged
in sedentary and commercial pursuits in Sana and other
towns in the fertile oases of southern Arabia, they report
that among the nomads of these deserts are wandering tribes
in no wise, so far as their external appearance goes, to be
distinguished from Arabs, but who are nevertheless purely
Jewish.
</p>

<p>
I also met while in Jerusalem a black Jew from Cochin in
India, where Jews have been established from time immemorial,
but he seemed somewhat vague as to his ancestry.
</p>

<p>
Among all these different nationalities and sects, which as
a rule hold each other in holy abhorrence, it is singular that
they all have one view in common, or rather, perhaps, it
should be said that they all seem to labour under one impression,
or presentiment, and that is that before very long
<span class="pageno target" title="312" id="page-312"></span>
the Holy City will undergo a change of some sort. The
nature of this change naturally takes the form peculiar to
the national or religious tendency of thought. With the
Russians and French it is reduced to a very simple political
expression, which may be summed up in the word annexation.
This idea is more firmly fixed among the Russians
than the French. Indeed, the Holy City plays a greater
part in the Greek religion than it does in the Latin, and the
affections of the orthodox are centred on these shrines to a
degree unknown among Christians of any other denomination.
There is hardly a village in Russia in which there is
not to be found a bottle of Jordan water, and the devotional
instincts of the peasantry, which are very strong, are directed
by the Church, which is in Russia synonymous with the government,
upon the holy places in Palestine, as shrines which
have a spiritual value not recognized by other churches to
the same extent, and which, therefore, when the day comes,
should entitle it to their temporal and territorial proprietorship.
In other words, there is not a Russian pilgrim who
visits Jerusalem who does not hope that he may live to see
the day when it will become a Russian city, and who does
not long for the call to a holy war, the object of which
should be the exclusive possession by Russia of the Church
of the Holy Sepulchre and of the city in which it stands.<a id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>
In France there is no such religious enthusiasm, except
with a section of society, and, although the conquest of Syria
<span class="pageno target" title="313" id="page-313"></span>
and Palestine enters into the programme of the government,
and their religious protectorate over the Latin Church and
its interests gives them a strong point of departure, it is
weakened by the fact that the government is professedly
anti-Catholic, and that, even were it not so, the sentiment
for the holy places is not so strong among the Latins as
among the Greeks. With the Protestants there is a large
class who base their belief in an immediately pending alteration
in the political conditions under which Jerusalem now
exists, upon their interpretation of prophecy. They profess
to find it clearly indicated in Ezekiel, Daniel, Revelations,
and elsewhere in the Bible, that the protectorate of Palestine
is to be vested in England. Among the Jews there are
many also, though they interpret the prophetic writings in
a totally different sense, who believe that the fulfilment of
the prophecy which is to restore to them their ancient country,
with its sacred city, is at hand, and all Moslem tradition
points to the present time as one critical to the fortunes of
Islam, with which the fate of Jerusalem, which is to them
also a holy city, is inextricably interwoven.
</p>

<p>
Whether we have any sympathy with any of these views
or not, the mere fact that so many nations and races of diverse
religions, from one point of view or another, centre their
political and religious aspirations upon this spot, makes it
the most interesting city upon the earth's surface, because
there is none other which, when its possession comes to be
disputed, will excite such powerful or such conflicting ambitions,
superstitions, and passions. These considerations become
doubly interesting when we connect them with the
events which are now transpiring in the East.
</p>

<p>
One day while I was in Jerusalem the huge bell which I
had seen dragged by Russian pilgrims along the road from
Jaffa arrived. It was destined for a new Russian church
which has lately been built upon the Mount of Olives.
Anxious to witness the ceremony of its reception, I set out
for the Mount and reached the summit just in time to see
the bronze monster, which I calculated weighed about eight
tons, arrive at its destination. A large crowd of Russian
men and women, headed by two priests of the Greek Church
in full canonicals, and chanting sacred songs, were dragging
<span class="pageno target" title="314" id="page-314"></span>
it to the platform from which it was to be finally elevated
into the belfry prepared for it. When, after much pulling
and hauling, it was at last placed upon the platform, a solemn
religious service took place. Every individual man and
woman in the crowd pressed forward to kiss the uplifted
crucifix which the priest presented for their adoration, crossing
and prostrating themselves, and crowding also around
the bell to kiss the various sacred groups of figures represented
upon it in <i>basso-rilievo</i>. At last, after a final melodious
chant in which all joined with great earnestness, the
officiating priest gave the signal for three cheers, which
was responded to with heartiness, and the ceremony was
over.
</p>

<p>
I now went to examine the interior of the new church
which it was intended to decorate, and was glad to find that
the accident which had led me to come here to witness the
arrival of the bell was the means of introducing me to a new
and interesting discovery of recent date. The Russians, in
excavating for the foundations of their new church, came
upon the pavement and other remains of an ancient building,
which they have been careful to preserve. Many of the most
interesting objects found are placed in a cabinet. In the hall
of the priest's house adjoining the church is a beautiful tessellated
pavement, representing animals, fish, apples, and
geometrical patterns, with an inscription in Armenian formed
of colored tesseræ. East of the gate into the garden, and
close to the house, is a rock-cut chamber, with a vault of
modern masonry. It measures about twenty-four feet by
fourteen, and contains sixteen sarcophagi, arranged in groups
of four, with a passage between. These were closed by slabs,
and on three inscriptions were dimly discernible. North
of this were the foundations of a building, apparently a
chapel, with a tessellated floor and a row of piers about two
feet square. Near by is a cave with a modern vaulted
chamber, and an iron door which has apparently been placed
there to protect a long inscription in old Armenian characters,
formed also of colored tesseræ, but I have no means of knowing
what it signifies. Beneath the floor of the house are said
to be other tombs, which can be reached through a masonry
trap-door. It is not unlikely that all these remains belong
<span class="pageno target" title="315" id="page-315"></span>
to an Armenian mediæval monastery. The site, which has
recently been acquired by the Russians, is some hundreds of
yards distant from the highest part of Olivet, where the
Latin chapel stands, usually visited by tourists who go there
to see Christ's footprint. It commands a magnificent view,
and the new Russian edifice will make an important addition
to their rapidly growing collection of sacred buildings.
</p>

<p>
Nothing is more aggravating to the members of either the
Greek or Latin churches than to find the rival sect in solitary
possession of a holy place. It is the immediate signal for
the purchase of another site as near as possible to the one
already occupied, and the erection upon it of an opposition
building. No greater piece of luck can befall the owner of
a piece of land than to stumble upon remains which show
that it had been in the occupation of the early Christians.
He can then name his own price, and, like the fortunate proprietor
of the land on which St. Stephen's Church is now
about to be built by the French, may get a thousand napoleons
for what he had a very short while before only paid
fifty.
</p>

<p>
Before bidding adieu to Jerusalem, it may be interesting
to my readers that I should notice some of the more important
discoveries that have been made there within the last
year or two, and which are not, therefore, to be found in
any guide-book. For many of the details I am indebted
to the Palestine Exploration Fund publications. Among
these have been many tombs, some of them of much interest,
but none equal to that to which I have already alluded,
as being the most likely of any which have yet been discovered,
to be the tomb of Christ. I have given at length the
reasons in a former letter in support of this presumption.
It is approached by a court cut in the rock seven feet square,
and two stones in this are so placed as to give the idea that
they may have held in place a rolling stone before the door.
On the right is a side entrance leading into a chamber with
a single loculus, and thence into a cave eight feet by ten.
If, instead of turning into this, we go straight on, we descend
two steps into a chamber six feet by nine; from either side
wall, and in the back wall of this chamber, are three low
passages; they lead into three other small chambers, each
<span class="pageno target" title="316" id="page-316"></span>
about seven feet long by six wide, and on each side of each
are stone benches on which bodies could be placed, with a
narrow passage between them; so that, in fact, the whole
tomb could contain six bodies. Whether it be the real
Holy Sepulchre or not, it is interesting from the fact that
it is the only Jewish tomb that has ever been found so close
to the ramparts of the modern city on the north, and to the
spot which may, with comparative certainty, be identified
with Calvary. It stands not very far distant from a piece
of land which a man bought a year or so ago for fifty napoleons.
On beginning to excavate for the foundations of
his house he came upon some tessellated pavement, carvings,
and all the evidences of remains of some importance. He
lost no time in making his discovery known, and, finding
that it stood upon what must have been the site of the early
Christian Church of St. Stephen, to commemorate the spot
of his martyrdom, the Roman Catholics gave the man a
thousand napoleons for his land, and have laid bare the remains
with a view to building another church over them. I
examined them with some interest, as it was such a recent
discovery, though the historical interest only dates back to
the year <span class="sc small">A.D.</span> 460, when it was built by the Empress Eudoxia.
The crusaders found it in ruins, since which time it
had become buried, and its site lost. The whole plan of the
church can now be distinctly traced, its pavements in many
places remaining perfect, with the foundations of its side
walls, fragments of columns, etc. The two most interesting
features in connection with it, however, are a slab of fine
limestone on which are the figures of the twelve apostles, each
surrounded by a sort of canopy. They stand six each side of
a central figure of a throned Christ. The figures are rather
stiffly drawn and have long robes; although they were very
distinct when first discovered, instead of moving the slab
under shelter, it has been left exposed to the storms of winter;
the result is that the outlines, which were in colour, can
now scarcely be distinguished, and another year will completely
efface them; besides this there is an inscription which
has so far puzzled experts, though it is in Greek characters,
but a good deal of it is effaced. There are also tombs in the
vicinity, but though rock-cut they are evidently Christian.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="317" id="page-317"></span>
</div>

<p>
Recent excavations within the city have also exposed a vast
area, depressed considerably below the present level of the
surface, which once formed the extensive establishment of the
Knights Hospitallers, or Knights of St. John. It was given
some time ago by the Turkish government to the Crown-Prince
of Germany; since then the whole place has been
cleared out with a view to its restoration on a grand scale,
and it will doubtless form, when completed, one of the finest
architectural monuments of modern date in Jerusalem. Several
very deep and finely-vaulted cisterns, with arches fifty
feet high, have been brought to light, besides cloisters, corridors,
and vaulted chambers hitherto unknown. Some idea
of the scale of the establishment which these celebrated
knights possessed in Jerusalem may be gathered from the
character and extent of the ruins, which cover an area of
one hundred and seventy square yards, of which only half,
unfortunately, belongs to the German government.
</p>

<p>
But the latest discovery, which has excited the greatest
interest, is that of the inscription in the tunnel which connects
the Virgin's Fount with the Pool of Siloam. The exploration
of this tunnel, which is about six hundred yards
long, involved great danger and difficulty. Colonel, now
Sir Charles Warren, gives a most graphic picture of the
horrors of his experience. For some distance the passage
was only one foot four inches high, and as there was one
foot of water, the explorers, who were crawling on their
stomachs, naked, were submerged to their chins, having only
four inches of breathing-room, with the additional danger
of being drowned by the rising of the waters, which does
not take place regularly. Often their mouths were under
water, and a breath of air could only be obtained by twisting
their faces up. To keep a light burning, to take measurements,
and make observations under these circumstances
was a work of no little difficulty; and yet, after crawling
through mud and water for four hours, the honour of finding
the inscription was reserved for a naked urchin of the town,
who, some years after, announced he had seen writing on
the wall. Whereupon Professor Sayce, and Herr Schick,
and Doctor Guthe plunge naked into the muddy tunnel with
acid solutions, and blotting-paper, and everything necessary
<span class="pageno target" title="318" id="page-318"></span>
to make squeezes, and emerge shivering and triumphant with
the most interesting Hebrew inscription that has ever been
found in Palestine, about which pamphlets and articles have
been written, and scholars have wrangled, but which is now
admitted to be as old as the time of Solomon, and it is
agreed on all hands that the interpretation thereof is as follows:
</p>

<p>
“Behold the excavation. Now this is the history of the
Tunnel. While the excavators were still lifting up the Pick
towards each other, and while there were yet three cubits
to be broken through, the voice of one called to his neighbour,
for there was an excess in the rock on the right. They
rose up. They struck on the west of the excavation. They
struck, each to meet the other, pick to pick. And there
flowed the waters from their outlet to the Pool, for a thousand
two hundred cubits, and . . . of a cubit was the height
of the rock over the heads of the excavators.” From this
it will appear that there were two working-parties, working
from opposite ends, and the indefatigable explorers have
actually discovered the spot where the “excess” in the
rock occurred and where they probably met. Most people
who have not got Palestine exploration on the brain will,
however, be content to take their word for it without going
to see for themselves. Still it cannot be denied that an
engineering work, executed in the time of Solomon, and an
inscription describing it, is of the greatest interest. The
date of the inscription can be determined with tolerable
accuracy by a comparison of the letters with those on the
Moabite stone and other of the most ancient inscriptions
known.
</p>

<div class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_5"></a>
<p class="foot"><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a>
<span class="sc">Russia in Palestine</span>.—The St. Petersburg correspondent of the <i>Daily
News</i> says, “In Palestine, the orthodox religion and Russian influence seem
to be increasing. Some days ago ‘The Orthodox Palestine Society’ celebrated
its anniversary. It was made known on this occasion that the society—which
is protected by the government, and which has one of the emperor's uncles,
the Grand Duke Nicholas Nicolaievitch, as president—numbers already six
hundred and fifteen members, and that its reserve capital amounts to about
90,000 roubles. The society has constructed a church at Nazareth, is constructing
a church at Mudshile, and has bought a piece of ground at Jerusalem.
The leaders of the Palestine Society assert that their researches have
proved in ‘the most indubitable’ manner that Christ, on his way to Golgotha,
‘passed just over the ground which has been bought by the society.’ One of
the society's tasks is to facilitate Russian pilgrimage to the Holy Land. The
emperor has recently given his sanction to the establishment of branches of
this society in all cities of the Russian Empire.”

<a href="#toc-59">THE THREE JERICHOS.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, Sept. 2.—The signs of progress to which I have alluded
in former letters as being manifest in Judea are not
confined to Jaffa and Jerusalem. The contemplated carriage-road
to Jericho will be an immense boon to the crowds of
pilgrims who flock annually to the Jordan. The first evidence
of activity in this direction was at the Khan el-Ahmah.
Here are the ruins of an old building. Fragments of walls
and broken arches remain, and a deep well indicates that in
former days it was inhabited—probably as a half-way house
of entertainment. Whether this be so or not, I was glad to see
a large force of stone-masons and builders actively engaged,
under the superintendence of a European, in erecting a handsome
khan or rest-house, which, considering that there is not
at present a single habitation between Jerusalem and Jericho,
with the exception of Bethany, distant only two miles
from the former city, is much needed.
</p>

<p>
This place has always had an evil reputation for thieves
since the days when the Good Samaritan performed his
charitable offices to the plundered and beaten wayfarer. Indeed,
it is at this very place that the spot is shown to the
credulous pilgrim where the incident in the parable is said to
have occurred, and the guide-books solemnly warn the tourist
that he must be careful to be provided with an escort, because
an English traveller, Sir Frederick Henniker, was attacked
here by Bedouins, stripped, wounded, and left for
dead in 1820. This is imputing stagnation to the Turkish
government with a vengeance. It moves slowly, it is true,
but the state of security has improved somewhat in sixty-five
years. Six years ago I rode alone with a friend from
Jericho to Jerusalem with no thought of danger. The
Bedouins find it to their interest to keep up the traditions of
the guide-books, and travellers continue to pay Bedouin
<span class="pageno target" title="320" id="page-320"></span>
sheiks blackmail which they might with perfect confidence
keep in their pockets. I consider the road from Jerusalem
to Jericho in the present day as safe as Broadway, at all
events in the daytime.
</p>

<p>
It might not be safe to venture along it quite alone at
night, but the same might be said of roads in other far more
civilized countries. Nevertheless, the road in places is so
wild and desolate that it may well appal the imagination of
the timid traveller, notably so where it enters the Wady Kelt,
a deep, narrow gorge, flanked by precipitous cliffs, honeycombed
with caverns, above which rise white chalk hills,
presenting a tangled network of narrow water-worn torrent
beds with knife-like ridges between. Hundreds of feet below
the path rushes a mountain torrent, which is none other than
the traditional brook Cheritt. Here, if we leave the regular
track, and make up our minds to follow a dizzy path cut out
of the precipitous cliff, which winds back up the gorge, soon
disappearing in the depth of its gloomy recesses, we plunge
into one of the wildest and weirdest scenes that the ingenuity
of nature has conceived in any country, so fantastic are
the crags and so labyrinthine the gorges. The only travellers
who ever thus diverge from the beaten route are Russian
pilgrims, whose devotional instincts lead them to pay
their homage to every accessible shrine, and to the credit of
the Greek Church it must be said that it has contrived to
perch shrines on spots which nature only intended for eagles.
</p>

<p>
One of the most notable of these is the monastery which
commemorates the cave, to which the path we are now
following will lead us, in which Elijah is said to have been
fed by the ravens. The monastery is literally hung on to
the face of the precipice, and consists of a series of cells, and
a hall supported on vaults through which lies the entrance.
A few Greek monks live, like birds perched on the edge of
a nest, in this singular abode, to which a chapel pinnacled on
a rock is attached, dating, if we may judge from the character
of the masonry, from about the twelfth century. Perhaps
the little side chapel, with rock-cut chambers, and the vault
containing ancient bones, to which a corridor covered with
frescoes representing the Last Judgment leads, is the oldest
part of these buildings, which were apparently constructed
<span class="pageno target" title="321" id="page-321"></span>
at three different epochs, as two layers of frescoes cover the
wall, while the newest is in its turn covered by the piers supporting
the ribs of the roof. Numerous caves, now inaccessible,
are visible in the face of the cliff, which for a distance
of about thirty yards is covered with frescoes now almost
entirely defaced. In front of one of the cells is a heavy
iron bar, from which, no doubt, in former days a ladder depended,
the only means of access when these caves, now almost
deserted, contained quite a population of hermits. This
curious place is well worth a visit, and though lying so close
to the tourist's route, I have not seen it described in any
guide-book.
</p>

<p>
On reaching the base of the hills where the Wady Kelt
debouches into the Jordan Valley, we find ourselves in the
immediate presence of four ancient sites. Three of these are
the sites of three different Jerichos, and one is the site of
Gilgal. It is certain that the Jewish, the Roman, and the
Byzantine Crusaders' Jericho occupied three different positions.
The first has been identified with tolerable certainty
as having existed where mounds of rubble mark its site, near
the spring called in old times the Fountain of Elijah, and
known now as the Ain es-Sultan. This was the Jericho of
Joshua, and these mounds of rubble may contain the débris
of the identical walls which fell to the sound of his trumpet.
We pitched our tents at the beautiful and copious spring
which must have supplied the old town with water, so as to
have an opportunity of examining the neighbourhood at our
leisure. The spring comes out beneath the mound on the
east, and has on the west a wall of small masonry in hard
cement. In this wall there is a small semicircular niche,
probably intended to hold a statue of the genius of the spring.
The reservoir from which the water gushes forth is about
twenty by forty feet, and, though shallow, forms a delightful
bath, with temperature slightly tepid. The high tumuli
behind had been excavated by Sir Charles Warren, and I examined
the traces of his cuttings. The mounds are formed
for the most part of a light yellow clay, which, on being
touched, crumbles into an impalpable powder. In some cases
no strata could be discerned in the clay, in others, layers of
brick, stone, and mortar were clearly visible. In another
<span class="pageno target" title="322" id="page-322"></span>
large mound, a little to the south, graves were found six feet
below the surface. All these except one were of sun-dried
brick. Bones appeared to have been thrown into these after
the decomposition of the bodies. Altogether Sir Charles
Warren dug trenches through no fewer than eight of the
mounds, which form a conspicuous feature in the plain in
which the ancient cities of Jericho were situated, as they
stand to a height of about sixty feet above it; and the result
at which he arrived was that they are formed by the
gradual crumbling away of great towers or castles of sun-burned
brick. Although in some cases shafts were sunk to
a depth of forty feet, nothing was found except pottery jars,
stone mortars for grinding corn, and broken glass. In one
were found, eight feet below the surface, the remains of a
large amphora, the neck, handles, and base of which were entire,
and which must have stood about five feet high. Sir
Charles Warren's working party consisted of one hundred
and seventy-four men, and he thoroughly exhausted the subject.
</p>

<p>
Near the spring is a ruin which may have been that of a
small Roman temple, a portion of an aqueduct, for the waters
of the spring evidently irrigated a large extent of the plain,
and near by traces of ruins, apparently Byzantine. Here are
pillar-shafts, cornices, capitals, and other indications of a city
of later date than those we have been considering.
</p>

<p>
The site of the Jericho of Herod, which existed at the
time of Christ, was at the mouth of the Wady Kelt, deriving
its water supply from that stream, and more than a mile
from Ain es-Sultan. Here there are the remains of a bridge,
foundations of buildings which were evidently Roman work,
and two large artificial mounds, in one of which was found
a rectangular chamber, the outer wall built of sun-dried
bricks, and the interior of undressed stones cemented over.
</p>

<p>
The site of the third, or Crusading Jericho, was probably
identical with that on which the modern village of Jericho
now stands; but no ruins of importance remain there, though
the whole surface of the plain between the sites of the three
Jerichos is covered with remains which attest the denseness
of the population which once inhabited it. That this should
once have been a large inhabited centre must ever appear an
<span class="pageno target" title="323" id="page-323"></span>
astounding fact to the modern traveller who has suffered
from the heat of the plain. Except during the winter months
all this region is not only unbearably hot, but most insalubrious.
The very Arabs desert it for the hillsides. It is
possible that neglect and inattention to irrigation works
may make the climate much less healthy than it was in
former times, but nothing can be changed in the matter of
temperature, and either the population must have deserted
it for the mountains during summer or they must have been
far better able to bear heat than their degenerate descendants.
Sunk nearly twelve hundred feet below the level of the sea,
and shut in from all breeze by lofty ranges of barren mountains
on both sides, Jericho in summer must be one of the
hottest places on the earth's surface. Even Jerusalem,
which is four thousand feet above it, is pretty warm. On
the other hand, Josephus vaunts the wonderful fertility of
the place, and calls it “a region fit for the gods.”
</p>

<p>
Its magnificent and extensive palm groves were celebrated,
but these have disappeared since the eighth century, and there
is only one date-tree left. Still the abundance of the water,
the richness of the soil, and the warmth of the climate, wonderfully
adapt it to the growth of all tropical produce. All
kinds of vegetables are in season all the year round. Grapes,
which are trellised on high poles, as in Italy, grow to enormous
size; indigo, cotton, and sugar would all flourish, but
there are no people to cultivate them.
</p>

<p>
The remains of the old aqueducts testify to the skilful
manner in which the ancients used their abundant water
supply for the irrigation of this extensive plain. I counted
altogether nine different ancient aqueducts. One or two of
these are still utilized, and of late years a handsome bridge
has been built in connection with one of them, but the engineering
skill of the ancients holds its own with our more
modern constructions. Many of the bridges by which these
aqueducts span the ravines are very handsome. Some are
on two tiers of arches, one above another. In places they
are tunnelled through the hills. One bridge of massive masonry
of large stones is one hundred and twenty feet long
and thirty-five feet high, with pointed arches. There is one
aqueduct eight miles long, consisting of a cemented channel
<span class="pageno target" title="324" id="page-324"></span>
two feet broad, and terminating in a handsome cemented
cistern. It is carried over several bridges, one fifty feet long
and thirty feet high.
</p>

<p>
I mention this system of aqueducts because I have never
seen any account of Jericho in the records of travellers or
in guide-books which does justice to them. They are important
as showing how much money must have been spent
in developing the resources of this plain, and what a garden it
must have been in old times. So late as the thirteenth century
we hear that the sugar-cane was cultivated around Jericho,
and I believe that at this day there are few spots on the
earth's surface which could be turned to more profitable account.
Here all the products of the tropics could be raised
without having to go to the tropics for them, and many
fruits could be conveyed from here to a European market,
which it would be impossible to preserve for the length of
time which is now required to transport them from the tropics.
At a comparatively small expense the ancient system
of aqueducts could be repaired and the abundant water supply
utilized, which is now left to stagnate in marshes and
breed fever and pestilence. It is, in fact, impossible to appreciate
the magnificent capabilities which this plain possesses
and not feel convinced that in these days of civilized
enterprise the question of their development is only one of
time.

<a href="#toc-60">JERICHO—A NEW WINTER RESORT.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, Sept. 15.—When I last visited Jericho, six years
ago, it consisted of a miserable village of mud huts,
containing a population of mixed negroes and Bedouins,
amounting at most to three hundred souls. I was astonished
now to find that, of all places in the world, it was
going ahead. There was a sort of boom going on; a very
minute boom, it is true, but still it was progress, and there
is no saying what it may lead to.
</p>

<p>
It is due entirely to the Russians, and I think that a progressive
Jericho, owing to Russian enterprise, is a phenomenon
worthy of remark. Indirectly it may be attributed to
the passion Russian pilgrims have for bathing in the Jordan
and carrying away bottles full of the water of that sacred
stream. This passion for holy ablutions is one which a wise
and far-seeing government has turned to profitable political
account. It was only in obedience to the most ordinary instincts
of humanity that some sort of accommodation should
be provided for the pious crowds, consisting largely of old
and frail women, who trudge thirty miles in a broiling sun
to bathe in the Jordan, and who could not find a roof to
shelter them, or a place in which to be fed, until they got
back to Jerusalem. So a large, handsome, red-stone building,
not unlike a state lunatic asylum, has been erected for their
accommodation at Jericho. Here not only the Russian pilgrim,
but the ordinary travelling lunatic, can find first-class
accommodation.
</p>

<p>
The protection which so handsome an establishment afforded
was all that was required to give a start to the place.
Devout Russians, always acting under the auspices of a
pious, intelligent, and paternal government, are beginning
gradually to make Jericho a place of winter resort. They
build little cottages there, surround them with gardens
<span class="pageno target" title="326" id="page-326"></span>
which supply them with most delicious fruit and vegetables,
spend their summers in Jerusalem, and come down here in
the winter and bathe in the Jordan to their hearts' content.
In other words, in a religious and quite unostentatious way,
Russia is quietly colonizing Jericho. The obnoxious word
colony, so hateful to Turkish ears, is never pronounced, but
I counted no fewer than twelve neat little whitewashed cottages,
where a few years ago there was not one.
</p>

<p>
One of my travelling companions, who was an English
medical man of some eminence, was so much struck with
the climatic advantages of the place as a winter resort for
consumptive patients that, now that good accommodation is
to be found there, he has decided to advise invalids to try
the effects of its air. Hitherto when one told a person “to
go to Jericho” it was a polite way of intimating to him that
he might go somewhere else, Jericho being the next hottest
place known to that more distant region; but now we may
tell our friends to go to Jericho in a spirit of benevolence, in
the hope that it may restore them to health. What an unbearable
place, by the way, Jericho would be if all the bores
who have been metaphorically sent there had literally gone.
As it is, I cannot imagine a more agreeable place for a person
not absolutely dependent upon society to go to and spend
a month or two in winter.
</p>

<p>
There is a peculiar softness and balminess in the air, not
to be found elsewhere in the world, for there is no other
place in the world eleven hundred feet below the sea-line.
There is a wide, level, open plain to scamper across on horseback
in all directions; there are thickets of tamarisk and
nebk and bamboo swarming with wild boar, deer, gazelle,
and other animals, some of them not to be found elsewhere,
to delight the sportsman. There is the Jordan handy, with
first-rate fishing to satisfy the most ardent angler; there is
the Dead Sea to bathe in and boat on (only there are no
boats) for persons whose tastes are aquatic. There is a flora
which would be a source of never-ending interest to the
botanist, for it is peculiar to this region; and the same remark
applies, to some extent, to its ornithology and entomology.
There are ancient ruins in all directions to satisfy
the most inveterate archæologist, while the explorer has only
<span class="pageno target" title="327" id="page-327"></span>
to cross the Jordan, and in a few hours he will find himself
in a region almost untrodden by the foot of the tourist, with
all manner of interesting discoveries awaiting him. Then
he is still comparatively in the world, for a smart ride of five
hours will take him back to Jerusalem, and he need not be
afraid of having to suffer hardship, for the fare in the Russian
hospice is reported excellent, especially in the matter of
milk and vegetables. My advice, then, to the invalid, the
sportsman, the man of natural history, and the antiquarian,
who may be looking out for a new winter resort, is, “Go to
Jericho!” There is no particular reason that I can see why
the Russians should have a monopoly of this charming spot,
though we should be very much obliged to them for making
it habitable. No doubt when the partition of “the sick
man's” property, for which they have been waiting so long,
takes place, they will put in a claim for Jericho.
</p>

<p>
Meantime I am glad to see that the government seem to
be put upon their mettle. Not only have they built a handsome
aqueduct across the ravine on which the modern village
stands, but they have cleared a large expanse of the
plain on the other side with a view of bringing it into cultivation
and irrigating it by means of the said aqueduct.
This plain extends in an unbroken level to the Dead Sea,
and affords a pleasant six-miles scamper. It is the grazing-ground
generally of large herds of camels, and on a hot
and thirsty day they come in very opportunely. They are
ever-ready if not ever-willing fountains, and there is nothing
more refreshing than a drink of warm camels' milk. It is
not easy to milk them, as they don't like strangers, and one
is apt to get charged by a savage mother who mistakes one's
intentions. Moreover, it requires some dexterity to milk a
camel into a tumbler. In fact, this is difficult with any
animal. I have had a battle with a nanny-goat on a bare
Palestine hillside when I was thirsty, which ended in my
utter discomfiture. The only plan is to backshish the
goatherd or camelherd. It is an odd sight to see a young
camel tugging away at one side of its mother and the camelherd
tugging away at the other, and the resigned old female
chewing her cud between them; it suggested to me a design
for a picture which I sent to an artist friend, to be called
<span class="pageno target" title="328" id="page-328"></span>
“The Rivals.” With the Dead Sea and the burning hills of
Moab for a background, I think it would make rather an
effective picture.
</p>

<p>
However often I might visit the Dead Sea, I would always
bathe in it, in spite of its stickiness afterwards. The sensation
of floating without the slightest effort for an indefinite
time when one is hot and tired is infinitely soothing.
</p>

<p>
The government intend building a bridge over the Jordan,
and on my way back from visiting its proposed site I passed
the much-disputed position of Gilgal, where the Israelites
made their first camp in the Promised Land. This has but
recently been identified by the ever-to-be-lamented Palestine
explorer, Mr. Tyrwhitt Drake, who fell a victim to his zeal
in the Jordan valley. Nothing is to be seen there now but
some mounds, in which have been found pottery, broken
glass, and tesseræ. It was for long the resting-place of the
Ark and the Tabernacle. It was somewhere on this plain
that Sodom and Gomorrah, “the Cities of the Plain,” were
situated, and not to the south of the Dead Sea, as was
formerly supposed, but their sites have been looked for in
vain.
</p>

<p>
The great events of which the plain of Jericho had in
early times been the scene, together with its traditional connection
with the temptation of Christ on the Mount, which
rises abruptly behind the Spring of Ain-es-Sultan, and actual
interest with regard to his baptism in the Jordan and other
events, attracted the Christians of a very early age to this
part of the country. Hence from Justinian's time the plain
began to be covered with monastic edifices, and the gorges
and precipices of the enclosing mountains to be burrowed
with hermit's caves and sacred shrines and chapels.
</p>

<p>
There is a tendency, on the part especially of the Greek
and Armenian churches, to reoccupy some of these. Certainly
of all the uncomfortable and dreary and broiling monasteries
I ever saw, that of Kusr Hajlah, near the Dead Sea, now inhabited
by half a dozen monks, claims pre-eminence. It is
placed just on the edge of the saline plain, which exhales in
summer a pungent heat that must render life almost insupportable.
Nevertheless, it bears all the marks of having
been an important mediæval monastery. The old walls still
<span class="pageno target" title="329" id="page-329"></span>
exist on three sides, and measure about forty yards by sixty.
These contained two chapels above ground and one beneath
in the vaults. The walls are still covered with frescoes, the
designs of which are distinctly visible, as well as the inscriptions
in Greek beneath them. They are evidently of Crusading
times. There is a large cistern here, thirty feet by ten
and twenty-four deep, which is in good preservation. So is
another at the monastery of El-Yahud, thirty feet deep, with
piers and arches also almost perfect. This monastery is distant
about half an hour from the Jordan, and dates from the
twelfth century. It stands on the site of one which was
called the Monastery of St. John on the Jordan, but which
was destroyed by an earthquake. The interest attaching to
these monasteries, however, is comparatively slight. Upon
archæological grounds they exhibit no very striking features,
while from a religious point of view they are significant
chiefly as showing how soon the religion of Christ became
degraded into a system of useless asceticism, and, considering
the tendency which is exhibited to return to it, the lamentable
reflection is forced upon one that the true spirit of
Christianity is as little understood now as it was in those
days.
</p>

<p>
The monks who inhabit these buildings are in one sense
as interesting as the buildings themselves, for one has only
to converse with them to be transported to the Middle Ages.
They are probably the only class of men who have remained
absolutely unaffected by nineteenth-century civilization or
modes of thought. They are like the toads that have been
locked up for centuries in stone, and might in so far as their
religious views are concerned be the identical individuals
who, in the time of the crusaders, used to inhabit the cells
they now occupy. From a psychological point of view, then,
it is curious to converse with them on matters of faith and
religion, for unless one has had personal experience of the
degree of ignorance and superstition which are still to be
found in a recluse of the Armenian Church, for instance,
one could not credit the fact that such a being exists; and
still represents a considerable class in the days in which we
live.
</p>

<p>
The Arabs around Jericho are of a tribe called Abou
<span class="pageno target" title="330" id="page-330"></span>
Nuseir. They venerate a place called “The Place of Sepulchre
of Dawar.” This personage was their ancestor, and the
Abou Nuseir bury their dead in the tombs of the Dawar
people. Arabs of any other tribe passing this spot make
use of the expression, “Permission, oh, Dawar,” and the
valley is sacred, and ploughs, grain, and other articles are
deposited here for safety. The usual votive offerings—sticks,
rags, bracelets—are found near the tombs. This tribe is
scattered about in tents among the thorny bushes that cover
the plain, amid which their flocks find good pasture. They
are reputed to have a bad character, but we made great
friends with them, owing to a circumstance which secured
their gratitude.
</p>

<p>
While sitting by the fountain one afternoon we saw a
number of Arabs carrying a man on a litter. This excited
our doctor's curiosity, and we immediately hailed the procession.
They told us they had a wounded man, and we
replied we had a doctor, and they waited till we came up.
In fact, an elderly man had just received a bullet in the leg
from a friend with whom he had had a quarrel, which splintered
the bone a little below the knee. The ball was still
lodged in the leg. The doctor, who had made five military
campaigns, and had probably dressed as many gunshot wounds
as any man alive, was in his element. Instantly the man
was taken to the nearest tents, splints of bamboo and bandages
of flour and the white of an egg were speedily extemporized,
while a large audience of wild—looking men, women,
children, and dogs crowded around to watch operations.
</p>

<p>
The ball was probed for, not with any surgical instrument,
for we were unprepared for any such emergency, but
with the finger. The only instruments forthcoming were a
penknife and a razor. The question was how to get the
ball out with such appliances. The occasion was one which
called for a display of genius, but the demand was not made
in vain; with that simplicity which is its most marked
characteristic, the doctor cut into the opposite side of
the leg with the razor, and then pushed the ball clean
through with his finger. The astonishment of the audience
was excessive at the appearance of the crushed bullet, and
the wounded man, a weather-beaten old Semite, who had
<span class="pageno target" title="331" id="page-331"></span>
bellowed lustily while the operation was going on, kissed
the doctor's hand effusively, and consoled himself with
coffee and cigarettes, in which we joined, while the bandaging
and splinting was in progress. For a couple of days
after this the doctor visited his patient twice a day amid the
warmest expressions of gratitude on the part of the tribe,
who forthwith brought all their sick to be cured, and the
blessings which were invoked upon us echoed in our ears
when we took our departure, till they died away in the distance.

<a href="#toc-61">A SHORT CUT OVER AN UNKNOWN COUNTRY.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, Oct. 1.—About half a mile in rear of our camp, at
Ain-es-Sultan, rose a precipice a thousand feet high, which
culminated in the lofty crest of a mountain called Quarantul.
It derives its name from a tradition which identifies it with
the mount upon which Christ was tempted for forty days in
the wilderness. Of course, it is not the mountain at all, or,
at all events, there is not the smallest particle of evidence to
prove that it is, but that is a trifle where sacred sites are
concerned. The face of this precipitous cliff is honeycombed
with the black mouths of caverns. Sitting round our camp-fire
at night we observed lights gleaming from the sheer side
of the rock. Otherwise there was nothing to lead us to suppose
that any of these caverns could be occupied by human
beings. But these fires excited our curiosity, and we determined
to pay the cave-dwellers perched so high above our
heads a visit.
</p>

<p>
The operation turned out a more dizzy one than I had
anticipated. No guide was necessary, for we could see the
track winding like a thread up the face of the precipice.
For the first three hundred feet or so it was all plain sailing,
but then the ledge became horribly narrow. Occasionally
the path was so steep that it dwindled into rock-cut steps.
A false step would have sent you thundering hundreds of
feet down into the abyss. At one place the height was so
dizzy, the foothold so slight, that my nerve, which for this
sort of work is not what it once was, began to give way, and
I ignominiously squatted down, with my face turned to the
rock, and tried to steady myself by forgetting that six inches
behind me was a yawning chasm, from which a pebble might
have been dropped plumb to the bottom. Retreat was as
bad as advance, and more humiliating. For the rest of the
way I went on my hands and knees, to the amusement of my
<span class="pageno target" title="333" id="page-333"></span>
companion, whose brain was not similarly affected. I don't
know anything more disagreeable than the irresistible impulse
which overtakes one sometimes to pitch one's self headlong
over a precipice of this kind.
</p>

<p>
At last, to my inexpressible relief, I reached the mouth of
a cave, into which I sprawled, panting, with thankfulness,
but oppressed nevertheless with the horrible consciousness
that I had the return voyage still to make. However, I dismissed
this painful consideration for the moment, and applied
myself to the examination of the curious grotto which
we had reached. It was a sort of ante-chamber to a tunnel
in the rock, passing through which we came upon some
dreadful steps out on the face of the rock; but here there
was a slight, rickety balustrade of wood, and at the top stood
a greasy old monk, a sight which, under the circumstances,
produced a more soothing effect upon my mind than such a
sight usually does. This ecclesiastical worthy received us
with gracious smiles, and led us through another tunnel into
a sort of vestibule, which opened into a chapel which had been
constructed at the mouth of a cave, so that the front facing
the precipice was of masonry. Looking out of the window
which had been constructed in this wall, a stone might have
been dropped at least five hundred feet without touching
anything till it reached the bottom. This chapel was gorgeously
fitted up, thanks to the contributions of pilgrims
whose heads must have been steadier than mine was. It
had a handsomely decorated screen covered with sacred
designs richly gilt. The apse was six feet in diameter, and
the total length from the inside of the apse to the back of
the cave about twenty-five feet, the breadth being about
twenty. A door led out of this chapel into a narrow passage
and up two or three steps into another cave, or niche,
where there was a figure of a saint.
</p>

<p>
As far as I could understand from the monk, who spoke
Greek, and very bad Italian, somewhere here was the spot
where Christ stood when he was tempted. The walls of the
chapel were covered with frescoes. The large, cavernous
vestibule was the dwelling-place of the monk, with whom
was associated a younger sort of acolyte, who lived in a cave
overhead, which was reached by a flight of stone-cut steps
<span class="pageno target" title="334" id="page-334"></span>
from the back of the vestibule. There was also a small
inner cave, fitted with a door, in which they kept their
stores. The old man told me he had lived here like an
eagle in an eyrie for ten years without even descending to
the plain below. I wondered how he kept his health without
taking exercise. All hermits who live on the sides of
precipices should, I think, have treadwheels of some kind
fitted up for them, or rotating cages like those in which
Italian white mice take their exercise. I don't think our
old friend, however, led a very ascetic life, so far as eating
and drinking are concerned. He insisted on our staying to
drink some excellent coffee, after which he produced a bottle
of very good mastic, or spirit made from corn and flavored
with anise-seed. I observed some fresh green salad and
cauliflower on his side-table, which the Arabs bring him
from their gardens at the foot of the hill. He had also an
abundant supply of good Arab bread. His water is supplied
from a cistern, of which there are several attached to
the caves. He told me that eight of these were at present
inhabited, but most of them were higher up. He was the
spiritual superior of them all, and although there was another
chapel in ruins, his was the only one in which service
was performed. He invited me to continue my explorations
to the caves higher up, but my mind was so much occupied
with thinking how I was to get down as to exclude from it
any idea of going higher up. Altogether this hermit was a
jolly, hospitable old fellow, and it would be as cruel to pick
him out of his hole and drop him into the busy world as it
is to pick a periwinkle out of his shell with a pin.
</p>

<p>
Partially shutting my eyes and presenting my rear to the
enemy, I crawled backwards down the giddy steps, and just
at an uncomfortable corner came upon a jet-black man in a
sort of priestly garb, who turned out to be an Abyssinian
hermit. He has no connection with the establishment I had
been visiting, having his own cell and his own church all to
himself. His bosom was stuffed with manuscripts in Ethiopian
characters. Under any other circumstances I would
have endeavored to converse with so rare a specimen of
ecclesiastical humanity; but how can a man engage in a
theological discussion in an unknown tongue, hanging between
<span class="pageno target" title="335" id="page-335"></span>
earth and heaven on six inches of slippery rock? I
felt rather inclined to say <i>vade retro Satanas</i>—not an inappropriate
remark, considering the mountain I was on; and
yet the poor man meant well, and, indeed, gave me an arm.
He does not stick to his perch, however, like the old raven I
had been visiting above, but usually resides in Jerusalem,
visiting his cave during the forty days of Lent and at other
stated periods.
</p>

<p>
We now determined to bid adieu to Jericho and the Mount
of the Temptation and to strike across country into Samaria.
This would take us over an unbeaten track and show us a
country very imperfectly known. We trusted to finding our
way by asking it, or by picking up local guides when we
were utterly at a loss. By this means, although one runs a
considerable risk of being benighted, or of having to scramble
over almost impracticable mountain paths, you get a better
chance of stumbling upon objects of interest than by following
a more trodden route. For more than two miles we
skirted in a northeasterly direction the base of the lofty cliffs
of the Jebel Quarantul. On our right a copious steam, which
has its rise in a fountain called Ain Duk, irrigated an extensive
tract of land, which was green and well cultivated. If
there had only been population enough to develop it properly
it would be a most productive region. There were all the
evidences that in ancient times its resources were not thus
neglected. Everywhere the remains of stone watercourses
and aqueducts were visible, one bridge in particular having
no fewer than three tiers of arches one above another. The
construction was ingenious and peculiar. At the bottom or
narrowest part of the ravine which it spanned was one huge
pointed arch. Immediately over this were four pointed
arches, while at the side of them was a fifth, double the
height of the others, the foundations of which were in the
steep side of the ravine. Above these again were six more
pointed arches which supported the aqueduct. Thus there
were altogether twelve arches, and of these only two were
the same size. The old Roman masonry of which they were
composed was still in a very good state of preservation.
Near this aqueduct were also the substantial remains of an
old Roman road.

We now crossed, for about three miles, a fine undulating
country covered with rich herbage, upon which large herds
of cattle were feeding, and followed most of the way an
ancient cemented channel, about four feet wide, which had
formerly conveyed the waters of another stream to swell
those which had their origin at Ain Duk, and all of which
were carried over the aforementioned high level bridge. The
stream which we were now approaching was also surrounded
by cultivated and irrigated land. The whole of this plain
in its richness and wealth of water far surpassed anything
my expectations had led me to anticipate. Near the base of
the mountains from which this fine stream issues are the remains
of an ancient fortress situated on a high mound or
tell, called Khurbet el Aujeh. The stream bears the same
name. This is the sixth large stream which I have counted
gushing from these mountains in a distance of about eight
miles. My compass now told me that I must get up into
the mountains if I intended to strike the Jerusalem and Samaria
road at the point which I proposed. From information
which I had taken before starting I expected to find the
track in question ascending the valley from which the Aujeh
issues, but we looked in vain for signs of any such track.
Indeed, on forcing our way up it a little distance, we found
that its precipitous sides closed in on us in a manner which
effectually barred all further progress. We were wondering
what to do in our dilemma, when, fortunately, we observed
some peasants making some irrigating channels, and
from them, after much chaffering, we obtained a guide. It
is a singular thing that these poor peasantry, whose day's
labor in the fields cannot be worth more than ten cents to
them, will refuse fifty rather than leave what they are about
and act as guides. On this occasion it was with great difficulty
that I bribed a man with a dollar. To our surprise he
took us straight to the base of an apparently impracticable
cliff and proceeded to climb up it. As my experience of
Palestine horses has convinced me that they can go almost
wherever a man can, provided you leave them to find their
own way, we proceeded to breast the limestone crags without
misgiving, the only hardship being that the day was hot
and we had to climb them on foot. To scramble up a
<span class="pageno target" title="337" id="page-337"></span>
thousand feet on a stretch by a path which was generally
quite invisible is no slight operation, and one which, in this
instance, it would have been impossible to perform without
a guide, such impassable barriers did the rocks seem to present
until the guide showed us the way to circumvent them.
When we did reach what we fondly hoped was the summit,
it was only to find a barren, undulating wilderness stretching
before us, every now and then involving more climbing,
for the elevation at which we were destined to arrive
before the end of our day's journey was more than four
thousand feet higher than the level from which we started.
</p>

<p>
If the scenery by which we now found ourselves surrounded
was rugged, it was wild and grand in the extreme.
Gloomy and precipitous gorges intersect these mountains in
every direction. Not a sign of a habitation is visible anywhere,
and with the exception of a single goatherd we did
not meet a human being for hours. The vegetation was
also very sparse, relieved, however, by great quantities of
the fragrant white broom in flower, and cyclamen and scarlet
anemones. Even in the days of the ancients it must have
been a barren, uncultivated tract, but I was repaid for the
scramble across it by one or two evidences of extreme antiquity
of the greatest interest. The first of these consisted
of four huge prostrate slabs of stone. They were evidently
the blocks which had once formed a dolmen that had been
overturned. Now, the interest of this lies in the fact that
no dolmen, or signs of a dolmen, has ever yet been discovered
in Judea, though eagerly searched for. There is only
one doubtful one in Galilee, but they are abundant to the
east of the Jordan. The reason assigned for this is that the
tribes to the east of the Jordan did not obey the command,
when they entered the land of Canaan, to “overturn the tables
of stone,” to destroy the Canaanitish altars, and to break
or smash their pillars; while the tribes to the west, especially
Judah and Benjamin, were very particular in this regard.
</p>

<p>
Here, I think, is the only evidence which has yet been
found in Judea of this interesting fact. This region was
apparently one much dedicated to Baal worship. I saw
many stone circles and one or two alignments of large
stones, but the most curious was an enclosure about twenty-four
<span class="pageno target" title="338" id="page-338"></span>
yards square, formed of rough, unhewn stones, each
weighing a ton or more, piled to a height of two or three
upon each other. In the centre was a circle, eight feet in
diameter, of large stones, with a single stone in the middle of
it. This was a monument which evidently existed from pre-Judaic
times; but, although I attempted hurriedly to take its
bearings, I am afraid that in that wilderness of stone I should
never be able to find it again.
</p>

<p>
We were pretty well worn out when we reached at last the
village of Mugheir, the first inhabited place we had seen
since leaving our camp near Jericho, and where we proposed
to call a halt for the refreshment of man and beast. Meantime,
as our tents and baggage had been sent by another
road, we began to feel extremely doubtful as to when we
should ever see them again.

<a href="#toc-62">EXPLORATIONS IN PALESTINE.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, Oct. 7.—The village of Mugheir, where we halted
to rest after our long and weary scramble from the Jordan
valley, is one of the most out-of-the-way places to be found
in Palestine. It is not on the way anywhere, but a sort of
<i>Ultima Thule</i>—the last spot where ground fit for cultivation
is to be found. It stands on the margin of a charming
little plain, where there is a fine olive grove. Indeed, looking
westward, the prospect is cheery enough, but eastward
it is wild rock, black, gloomy gorges, or less precipitous but
equally barren valleys. The sheik received us with great
cordiality, albeit quite unused to the visits of travellers, and
spread before us such fare as he could, flat Arab bread,
roasted eggs, curdled goat's milk, and figs, butter, and honey.
I mention the last three together because you eat them
together. You first dip your dried fig into the butter, you
then dip it into the honey, and then put it into your mouth.
I never tried the combination before, but it is not bad. He
also gave us a hot compound of flour and sugar boiled together,
which he seemed to think a great deal of, but, beyond
being sweet and sticky, it had no especial merit. His
wife was the fairest woman I ever saw for a pure-blooded
fellahah peasant. In fact, she could not have been fairer
had she been a blue-eyed, light-haired Swede or German.
</p>

<p>
After satisfying my hunger I went to look for antiquities,
and found several rock-cut tombs and cisterns, a fine
rock-hewn wine-press, and four towers all in a good state of
preservation, and three of them inhabited. They measured
thirty feet square and as many in height. The basement
stones were massive enough to be the masonry of a former
period, but exactly of what date I am unable to say, possibly
not earlier than the crusades; though I found some
foundations of walls which I am inclined to ascribe to a
<span class="pageno target" title="340" id="page-340"></span>
much older date. There has been probably a town or village
here from time immemorial, though I am unable to identify
it with any Biblical site.
</p>

<p>
The sheik insisted upon accompanying us himself as
guide to a place called Singil, which we had fixed upon as
our night quarters. Our way led us through a small, depressed
plain. After passing some remains of no special interest
we reached a very remarkable ruin, called El-Habs.
It is a tower on a rocky scarp, with walls built partly of
masonry, partly of rock, which measure about sixty feet by
thirty. The stones of which these walls are composed are
of immense size, measuring from twelve feet up to eighteen
feet in length, with a height of from three to four feet each.
The masonry is thus quite equal to the average size of the
temple stones in Jerusalem. The tower has two entrances.
Near it are the remains of another large building of about
one hundred feet square outside measurement, and with
walls six feet thick. Its interior is divided into four parallel
chambers, running east and west, of various breadth.
One of the partition walls has archways through it, with
piers between. All round these buildings are the foundations
of ancient walls and houses and bell-mouthed cisterns.
The whole place bears the marks of extreme antiquity. It
has been examined by the officers of the Palestine Survey,
but is not mentioned in any guide-book, and I am unable to
form any conjecture in regard to it.
</p>

<p>
Our road now lay through a fertile plain, called The
Meadow of the Feast, possibly in some connection with the
yearly feast which used to be held by the Jews in old times
at Shiloh, from which historical site we were not far distant.
It is a comfort now and then to come upon a Biblical
site about the identity of which there is not the slightest
doubt, and such is the case with Seilun, the modern name
for Shiloh. It stands in an extremely retired valley, and on
our way to it we put up the third batch of gazelles we had
started in one day. This was the spot where the Tabernacle
was first permanently set up in Canaan, and where the
Israelites assembled to allot the Promised Land. They were
probably encamped hard by on The Meadow of the Feast,
across which we had just been riding, and it was probably
<span class="pageno target" title="341" id="page-341"></span>
on this meadow, while the maidens were dancing at the festival
in honour of the ark, that the remnant of the Benjamites
concealed themselves among the vineyards on the hillsides
and carried off two hundred maidens. At present it
is impossible to be certain whether any of the remains now
visible existed at the time when the Tabernacle was there.
The ruins which first strike the eye on the hillside are evidently
those of a comparatively modern village, with here
and there fragments of masonry which may date back to
Crusading times. Then there is a low, square building supported
by two rows of columns, which has been used as a
mosque, but in early times may have been a Christian church;
but the most remarkable monument is a square building of
which only the walls remain. It is apparently of three architectural
periods, and it is just possible that the oldest
may have been Jewish. The original walls have been added
to by a sloping scarp having been built against them, so that
the wall, which is about fourteen feet high, is nine feet thick
at the bottom, and about three feet thick at the top. Inside
are some fragments of columns, capitals, and a door
lintel, which has recently fallen from the principal entrance,
on which are carved two wreaths, flanked by two double-handled
pitchers, and in the centre an amphora.
</p>

<p>
There are no inhabitants at Shiloh now, so we pushed on
to Singil, a village situated about three thousand feet above
the sea-level, and commanding a most magnificent view.
The villagers here showed me some foundations of what
they said had been an old castle built by a certain King Sinbil,
but I strongly suspect that they substituted the b for a
g, as the village takes its name from a certain Crusading
hero, who was afterwards canonized and became St. Gilles,
and that here he built himself a castle. The natives also
sent me into a cave on a wild goose chase after an inscription,
which, after much scrambling with lighted tapers, I
failed to find.
</p>

<p>
We had now left Judea, and were entering ancient Samaria,
which is governed, not from Jerusalem, but Damascus,
the seat of government being Nablous, a large town of
about twenty thousand inhabitants, whose principal industry
is the manufacture of soap, with which they supply almost
<span class="pageno target" title="342" id="page-342"></span>
the whole country. The town is squeezed in between
the lofty hills of Ebal and Gerizim, both of which are over
three thousand feet above the sea-level. This is the valley
of Shechem. Nothing can exceed in picturesqueness the
situation of this place and the beauty of its surroundings,
especially when the almond and peach trees are in bloom in
the valley. The steep hillsides seem to be a mass of huge
cactuses; these are used to line the terraces of the vineyards
as hedges, but as they are great absorbers of vitality from
the soil, I should think they must impoverish the land. In
the autumn these ungainly plants are thickly covered with
fruit about the size of a large fig, when ripe of a bright red.
They are full of small seeds, but sweet and refreshing. The
natives gorge themselves upon them, as they are esteemed
wholesome, but they are traps to the unwary and inexperienced
of the most painful kind, being covered outside with
diminutive and almost invisible prickly hairs. The first time
I ever tried to eat one I filled my mouth with these unpleasant
little spikes, and spent half an hour with my tongue out,
while a friend was engaged with a pair of tweezers extracting
each individual irritant, but then he only partially succeeded,
and for the rest of the day I felt as if I had tried to
swallow half a chopped-up hair-brush. The natives pick
the fruit by digging a pronged iron into them, with which
they twitch them off the stalk; they then roll them on the
ground, so as to get the hairy prickles off, and then carefully
peel them. The great green leaves have spikes like
pins half an inch long upon them, which inflict a most vicious
and poisonous prick. I once tumbled into a cactus
bush, and really suffered severely for many hours. Under
these circumstances it is something amazing to see camels
munching these leaves, prickles and all, with apparent relish;
a donkey eating thistles is a joke to it.
</p>

<p>
Nablous is also surrounded by extensive olive groves, and
the oil is celebrated throughout Palestine; it also exports
cotton of native growth. In fact, for a Moslem city, it may
be considered an enterprising and go-ahead place. At present
it lacks the prime necessity of a carriage road to the sea-coast.
All its exports and imports have to be conveyed on
the backs of camels. If the long-projected railway from
<span class="pageno target" title="343" id="page-343"></span>
Haifa to Damascus could ever be consummated, a wagon
road could easily be constructed in connection with it, and
Haifa would then become the port of Nablous, instead of
Jaffa, which is slightly nearer to it. With the exception of
the long central street, which forms the principal bazaar, the
streets as a rule are more gloomy and tunnel-like than most
Oriental towns, though there are many handsome stone
houses, and the building of new ones afforded evidence of
the growing wealth of the inhabitants. The consequence
is an improvement in the reputation of the population, who
have in former times been notorious for their turbulent fanaticism,
but of late years the Turkish government has succeeded
in establishing its authority on a firmer foundation
and making its exercise felt. Indeed, the superficial traveller
in the Turkish empire, who only sees the defects of the
existing system of administration, is hardly a fair judge of
the progress that has been made in a certain direction unless
he is able to compare it with what has been.
</p>

<p>
There can be no doubt that during the last twenty years
a great change has been worked in the establishment of law
and order and in the security of life and property. If oppression
has the disadvantage of grinding the people and
making their lives miserable, it, at all events, has the merit
of intimidating them and restraining them from acts of violence
and crime. If the unjust judge and extortionate tax-gatherer
are taking the heart out of the people, they are
taking the pluck out of them, too, and one result is that the
stranger can now travel in safety through regions where he
was once sure of being plundered and possibly murdered,
and walk unmolested through Moslem crowds, where formerly
he might have been subjected to insult. Nor is this
due to the direct action of any foreign power or to the exercise
of any diplomatic pressure in favor of reform. On
the contrary, the influence of foreign powers was never so
low as it is at present, and I am convinced that all attempts
on the part of foreign powers to enforce reforms on Turkey
only hinder them. The influence of the sultan and his government
is not to be maintained throughout Islam by any
action in obedience to the dictates of Christian powers.
They resent it, just as the South used to resent the interference
<span class="pageno target" title="344" id="page-344"></span>
of the North in the matter of slavery; but this does
not prevent their being alive to any advantages which accrue
to the empire by enforcing, as far as may be, a respect
for law and order; and, so far as it is possible, to develop
its resources without being beholden to foreign capital, or
increasing the power and influence of the native Christian
population. The difficulty is that the instinct of the Moslem
is not in favor of progress, and that he is always outstripped
in the race by his Christian neighbour.
</p>

<p>
Again, the country can only be developed through the
education and enlightenment of the people; but where an
administrative system is in itself corrupt and unenlightened,
the education and illumination of the masses means their
endowment with the faculty of perceiving abuses, and possibly
with a determination to resist them; and this danger
is so great that it must be averted, even at the cost of the
national prosperity. For this reason the government sets
its face against the education of Moslems in Christian
schools, not because they are afraid of the Moslems being
converted to Christianity—there is not the slightest danger
of that—but because they are afraid of their imbibing Western
ideas of social and political life, which are opposed to
the conditions which characterize the existing administration
of affairs. In fact they are not opposed to reform, but
it must be a reform not suggested from without, nor imposed
upon them from within; it must neither be in obedience
to diplomatic pressure nor to popular clamour; it must
be a reform of their own initiative, and as any such reform,
to be effectual, must begin by the authorities with whom it
is to originate reforming themselves, the process seems almost
hopeless. Still, as I have already remarked, there has
distinctly been change, and change for the better, so far as
security for life and property and the extension and enforcement
of official authority are concerned, during the
last twenty years—security of property to the people, be it
understood, from their own mutual plundering propensities.
Whether this security extends to the demands of the tax-gatherer,
and how far it has conduced to their own material
welfare and happiness, is quite another question.

<a href="#toc-63">SACRED SAMARITAN RECORDS.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, Oct. 15.—The chief interest connected with Nablous
lies in the fact that it is the residence of the remnant
of those Samaritans who were colonized here by Shalmaneser,
King of Assyria, when he carried away the children
of Israel captive. From the Biblical record (2 Kings xvii.),
it would appear that the new settlers were drawn from
mixed nationalities and various cities within his dominions.
Some came from Babylon itself, some from Hamath,
a town between Damascus and Aleppo, and others from
Cuthah—probably the Kutha of Arabian geographers, a
town and district between the Tigris and Euphrates—some
from Ava, which has been identified with the modern Hit,
and some from Sepharvaim, once the famous city of Sippara,
both cities on the Euphrates, in lower Mesopotamia.
</p>

<p>
We are also told that the new colonists petitioned the
King of Assyria to be taught the religion of the Jews, and
that he sent them a Jewish priest to teach it to them, and
that they added it on, after a curious fashion, to the various
forms of idolatry which they had imported from their different
localities, and hence established a mongrel sort of
worship, which became afterwards purified, but which nevertheless
rendered them especially obnoxious to the Jews of
Judea, all the more so because they intermarried with the
remnant of the tribes of Israel which had escaped the captivity,
thus forming a race as mongrel as their religion. It
is about twenty-six hundred years since this event took
place, but the ancient worship of the Samaritans exists to
this day; so also does the bitter antagonism which they and
the Jews entertain for each other.
</p>

<p>
This is the oldest national feud, probably, in existence, but
is as fresh as if it only originated yesterday. Like the Jews,
the Samaritans have managed to survive all the vicissitudes
<span class="pageno target" title="346" id="page-346"></span>
of fate, but with the difference that a small remnant has
clung through them all to the locality in which they were
originally established, though they have dwindled in numbers
to one hundred and sixty souls. As an ethnological fraction
of antiquity they are, perhaps, the most interesting group
of people extant. The first one I ever made acquaintance
with was a young man who called upon me in a mysterious
manner one day in Haifa. He handed me a document in
Arabic, in which, after stating that for certain reasons, which
he implied were by no means discreditable to him (he was
an outcast from his own people), he implored charity, and
requested me “to cast upon him a regard of compassion and
benevolence.” The document further said:
</p>

<p class="block-quote">
“All that I have inherited from my parents and ancestors is a manuscript
written in ancient Hebrew, nine hundred years old, containing two chapters
of the Bible, including the commandments, which I beg to offer you, in the
hope that you will recompense me in return by a sum which will relieve my
distress.”
</p>

<p>
He signed himself “Shellabi, the son of Jacob, the Samaritan.”
Now, I knew that Jacob es Shellabi was once the
spiritual head of the sect, for he had been in London under
the title of “The Prince of the Samaritans,” and the romance
which attended his style and dignity had, it was reported,
even captivated a fair Englishwoman, who was willing
to become a Samaritan for his sake. Fortunately for
her “the Prince” was already married, a fact which I believe
he only divulged on his return to his native land.
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, here was the son of a prince in distress, and
here was an extremely ancient and curious manuscript for
sale. The youth looked such a scamp, however, that he did
not enlist my sympathies. I suspected that he had lost his
money by gambling, which proved afterwards to be the case;
so when he said he considered the manuscript worth ten
dollars I offered him one dollar, on which he retired indignantly.
A few days later, however, he reappeared, took his
dollar thankfully, and I retain possession of the manuscript.
It is on coarse parchment of a yellowish-brown color, two
feet six long, and fifteen inches wide. It was evidently
originally longer, but has been torn off. One edge has been
subjected to the action of fire. The writing is in transverse
<span class="pageno target" title="347" id="page-347"></span>
columns, each column thirteen inches long by five wide, and
containing from sixty to seventy lines. The characters are
of the old Samaritan type, small, rude, and irregular, differing
in many important respects from the ancient Hebrew,
and illegible to a good modern Hebrew scholar to whom I
have shown it. I have no doubt, however, that it could be
deciphered by an expert in such matters, who would also
be able to establish from the formation of the characters its
antiquity.<a id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
</p>

<p>
This incident excited my interest in the Samaritan question,
and when I was at Nablous I visited the synagogue,
examined the ancient Thorah, or book of the law, and have
since looked into the subject generally. The ancient synagogue
was appropriated by the Moslems some centuries ago.
The modern building is a small, unpretentious, oblong structure.
The walls are rough and whitewashed, and the roof
is vaulted with two little domes in the centre. The mizbah,
or altar, is about five feet square, covered with a veil of
yellow silk. Within are receptacles for the sacred books.
Of these the most valuable are never shown to strangers.
One or two persons have, however, seen the most ancient,
which the Samaritans claim to have been written by Abishua,
the son of Phinehas, thirty-five hundred years ago. It is
only seen by the congregation once a year, when elevated
above the priest's head on the Day of Atonement.
</p>

<p>
The Thorah was rolled round a cylinder of wood similar
to those used in ordinary Jewish synagogues, and I was
gratified to observe that it exactly resembled the fragment
in my possession. It was evidently very ancient. The priest
who showed me the synagogue was a remarkably handsome,
dignified-looking man about forty years old. I asked him
whether he was the chief priest. He said he was, and that
Jacob Shellabi no longer had any position among them. I
then said I had obtained a piece of manuscript from his son,
to which he made no reply, but at once turned the subject.
I suspect the youth was a <i>mauvais sujet</i>, who committed an
act of sacrilegious theft before leaving the paternal mansion,
and who did not, therefore, deserve more than he got.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="348" id="page-348"></span>
</div>

<p>
Now, with regard to the sacred books which I did not see:
They are in some respects in the highest degree interesting,
as throwing light upon the Biblical record. In the first
place, from what is known of the most ancient version,
claiming to be by Abishua, Gesenius and other great scholars
have given it as their opinion that if it could be collated,
it would be found in many cases to preserve the sense,
which has been lost in the Jewish version. This opinion is
founded upon the results of such collation as has been possible
with Samaritan texts which have fallen into the hands
of scholars.
</p>

<p>
Besides the most ancient roll there are three other books
known to be in the possession of the Samaritans.<a id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor"><sup>[7]</sup></a> These are
the Samaritan book of Joshua, the Samaritan Chronicle, and
the so-called “Fire-tried Manuscript.” The Samaritan book
of Joshua probably dates from the thirteenth century. It
was published at Leyden about forty years ago from an
Arabic manuscript in Samaritan character, and is thought to
have been compiled from an early Samaritan and three later
Arabic chronicles. It is invested with a peculiar interest
from the fact that it helps to supply a remarkable lacuna in
the Biblical record, which does not appear to have received
the attention it deserves from Biblical students. It is, in
fact, evident that a large portion of the present book of
Joshua is missing. That book purports to be an account of
the conquest of Canaan and its allotment among the twelve
tribes. Under these circumstances it is most remarkable that
we have no account of the conquest of Samaria, though the
campaigns in the south, including the siege and taking of
seven cities, and the invasion of Galilee, and the defeat of
the league of six kings of Northern Palestine, are fully described.
Then we have no list of royal Samaritan cities,
though all of them in the other parts of the country are
carefully enumerated. We have no description of the boundaries
of the two tribes to which Samaria was allotted, nor
any list of the cities awarded to them. Some of the Levitical
towns mentioned in Chronicles as belonging to Samaria are
not to be found in Joshua. It will be found also that, taken
<span class="pageno target" title="349" id="page-349"></span>
as a whole, there are only about forty Samaritan places
noted out of some four or five hundred places in Western
Palestine.
</p>

<p>
The Jewish hatred of the Samaritans rose in the early
Christian period to so great a pitch that the Mishnic doctors
avoided even mentioning the name of Samaria. Thus,
in the Talmud only some half-dozen Samaritan towns are
noticed. In describing Palestine the Mishna divides it
into Judea, Galilee, and Peræa, leaving out all mention of
Samaria. It is just possible that long before this an omission
may have been purposely made by the early transcribers
of the Biblical book of Joshua in regard to Samaria. At all
events, the meagre record which it contains is richly supplemented
by the Samaritan book of Joshua, which brings down
the history of Israel from the date of the conquest to the
time of Samuel, whose predecessor, Eli, was, from a Samaritan
point of view, the earliest schismatic, and the founder of
a new and heretical temple at Shiloh in opposition to that
built by Joshua on Mount Gerizim. The divine glory rested
upon Gerizim for two hundred and sixty years, or during the
reign of nine successors of Joshua, the schism between the
children of Judah and the orthodox, as the Samaritans call
themselves, dating from the time of Sin, after the death of
Samson.
</p>

<p>
The book opens much in accordance with the Biblical narrative,
but no less than four chapters are devoted to the history
of Balaam and his death, being an enlargement of one
Biblical verse. The conquest of Shechem by Joshua contains
an account of the miraculous discomfiture of the enemy,
and of a letter sent by him announcing it to Eleazar, the
priest, fastened to the wings of a dove. It contains also the
account of a new league against the children of Israel under
a king called Saubac, in conjunction with the kings of five
other towns, which can all now be identified. A thrilling
narrative of the battle which takes place between Joshua
and these kings at El-Lejjun, on the ancient Megiddo (Armageddon),
is also given. With this episode the history of
the war ends. The chief value of the book lies, however, in
the light it throws upon the ancient geography of Samaria.
Out of a total of thirty-one places mentioned in it, thirteen
<span class="pageno target" title="350" id="page-350"></span>
are within the confines of Samaria, and most of these are
not to be found in the Bible.
</p>

<p>
The Samaritan chronicle goes back to the beginning and
gives the astronomical reckoning from Adam. Some of its
topographical details are of much value. Thus it contains a
list of twenty-two towns where the high-priest who succeeded
Tobiah resided, all being apparently in Samaria as
far as they can be identified. It is known that in the second
and third centuries the Samaritans were in a very flourishing
condition, and had colonies in Egypt, and even a synagogue
in Rome. The chronicle gives their possessions in
Palestine as allotted by the High-Priest Baba the Great,
about one hundred and sixty years after the destruction of
Jerusalem. This description is interesting, as it seems to include
all Palestine, with the exception of Judea proper, to
the mountains of which the Jews are confined.
</p>

<p>
At a later period the chronicle gives a list of those towns
which were inhabited by the Samaritans after the Hegira.
This is a period when very little is known of this nation.
The places mentioned extend nearly over the whole of Palestine
outside of Judea, and colonies are also mentioned in
Damascus, Cairo, and Baalbek. There is a ruin about five
miles from Haifa called Kefr Samir, or the town of the
Samaritans, which I occasionally visit to grub for inscriptions,
which was one of their colonies. Those at Gerar and
Gaza lasted till the present century, but none are to be found
now outside of Nablous. It is only to be expected that the
chronicle should centre all the holy places of the Samaritans
at Shechem or Nablous.
</p>

<p>
The fifth article of the Samaritan creed was the assertion
that Gerizim was the chosen abode of God upon earth.
Here Adam and Seth raised altars; here Melchisedec, servant
of the Most High God, was met by Abraham—for Gerizim
the Samaritans hold to the present day is the highest
mountain in the world, the only one not covered by the
flood. Here Abraham offered up Isaac, the very spot being
shown on the eastern brow of the mountain; and, indeed, as
Dean Stanley has argued, it is as likely to be here as at
Jerusalem, as Josephus and the Talmudists affirm. Gerizim
was also the site of Jacob's vision, and, finally, it was on
<span class="pageno target" title="351" id="page-351"></span>
Gerizim, and not on Ebal, just opposite, as stated in the
Bible, that, according to the Samaritans, Joshua erected,
first an altar, afterwards the tabernacle, and lastly a temple.
</p>

<p>
The fourth and last of the known ancient sacred books of
the Samaritans is the fire-tried manuscript. It consists of
two hundred and seventeen leaves, containing the law from
the twenty-ninth verse of the first chapter of Genesis to the
blessing of Moses in Deuteronomy. It is much worn; the
letters are not so small as those of Abishua's roll, nor as
large as those of the later roll. The hand is steady and
uniform, and the character of the letters indicates that it is
of very ancient date. A note at the end of the book of
Numbers connects the manuscript with a story in the Samaritan
book of Joshua. It runs:
</p>

<p class="block-quote">
“It came out from the fire by the power of the Lord to the hand of the
King of Babel in the presence of Zerubbabel the Jew, and was not burned.
Thanks be to the Lord for the law of Moses.”
</p>

<div class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_6"></a>
<p class="foot"><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a>
This MS. has since been examined, and is pronounced to be part of the
Pentateuch in Samaritan characters of the fifteenth century.
</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_7"></a>
<p class="foot"><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a>
I am indebted to the researches of the Palestine Exploration Fund for
these details.

<a href="#toc-64">THE TEN LOST TRIBES.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, Oct. 25.—In my last letter I gave some account
of the ancient literature of the Samaritans, which is still
extant and in their possession. The people themselves, however,
are such an interesting ethnological fragment of a remote
past that there are many points connected with their
origin and history which are worthy of consideration, the
more especially as they bear upon a problem which has, of
late years, exercised a singular species of fascination over a
certain class of minds. I refer to the so-called “lost” ten
tribes. It may be a disappointment to the Anglo-Israelites
to suggest that they are more likely to be found in the
neighbourhood of the country they were carried from than
in England; but, under the circumstances, it is certainly a
more rational and less strained hypothesis, as I think may
be clearly shown by a reference to existing traditions, facts,
and records.
</p>

<p>
It would appear from the recently discovered cuneiform
tablets which are now under the investigation of Assyrian
scholars, that, while they substantially afford a remarkable
confirmation of Biblical history, there are certain discrepancies
in regard to the capture of Samaria and the carrying
away of the Israelites into captivity, which make it somewhat
difficult to determine the exact date and nature of that
event. The complete recovery of the records of Shalmaneser
(IV.), who no doubt did besiege Samaria, will clear
this up, and throw light upon the records of his successor,
Sargon, who seems to have succeeded to the throne about
the time of the capture of the city, after a three years' siege,
and who in that case would be the monarch who actually
carried off the Israelites. If this were so, then, according to
the date of his accession, the captivity must have occurred
before the invitation which Hezekiah sent out through the
<span class="pageno target" title="353" id="page-353"></span>
country of Ephraim and Manasseh inviting Israelites to the
Passover at Jerusalem, where we are informed that large
numbers attended it (2 Chron. xxx. 18); and it would put
beyond a doubt, what is in fact most probable, that Sargon,
in carrying away the Israelites captive, did exactly what
Nebuchadnezzar also did not long afterwards, when he carried
off the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, and left a large
population of the poorer classes behind, who were not worth
taking.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, when one comes to consider the population which
we know to have inhabited Samaria and Galilee at this time,
it seems incredible that any conqueror would have burdened
himself with a host which must have numbered at the lowest
estimate over a million souls and probably a great many
more; and this conjecture is borne out by the fact that we
read, in Jeremiah xli. 5, that a deputation of fourscore Israelites
came to Jerusalem after its destruction, or more than a
hundred years after the captivity of the Israelites. That
the Israelites thus left intermarried with the colonists sent
from Assyria on the adoption by these latter of the Jewish
religion, under the instruction of a priest sent for the purpose,
is extremely probable. The Samaritans themselves,
however, deny all intermixture with the colonists, and maintain
they are pure-blooded Israelites; and in confirmation of
this we may mention their marked Jewish type of countenance,
their possession of an ancient text of the books of
Moses, and their observance of the Jewish Passover according
to the most ancient forms of that rite.
</p>

<p>
The Samaritan account of their origin and composition is,
as may be supposed, diametrically opposed to that contained
in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah. They assert that at
the time when the two tribes returned from the captivity
a large number of the ten tribes also returned to Samaria
under Sanballat, called by Nehemiah a Horonite, but the
Samaritans call him a Levite. The Samaritan account goes
on to state that while the two tribes under Zerubbabel repaired
to Jerusalem, the rest of the congregation, three hundred
thousand in all, besides youth, women, children, and
strangers, were led to Gerizim, where they established the
Temple. Then came the quarrels between the Jews at Jerusalem
<span class="pageno target" title="354" id="page-354"></span>
and the Israelites at Samaria about the building of
the Temple; and the accounts contained in the books of
Ezra and Nehemiah and the Samaritan records are not very
discordant. Making allowance always for the fact that the
Biblical books do not admit that the Samaritans were Israelites
at all, though they admit that Sanballat's son was married
to the daughter of Eliashib, the Jewish high-priest,
while this latter is stated to have allied himself with Tobiah,
who was a Samaritan priest. This caused great displeasure
to Nehemiah, and increased the schism, but it goes, too, far
to confirm the supposition that Sanballat and Tobiah were
Israelites.
</p>

<p>
The Samaritans are, indeed, in the peculiarities of their
doctrine, almost identical with the original Jewish party—the
Karaite and Sadducean sects. They are even called Sadducees
in Jewish writings, and their denial of the resurrection
was, like that of the Sadducees, based on the declaration
that nothing was to be found in the law of Moses on the
subject. Again, their version of the law is closely similar
to that of the Septuagint, which was a translation authorized
by a Sadducean high-priest from a text differing from that
finally established by the Pharisees. It is often supposed
that the Samaritans borrowed their doctrine from the Sadducees,
but it seems more rational to admit that they were
a sect originally identical, because originally Israelite. The
animosity of Josephus, who was a Pharisee; the fierce denunciation
of the Talmud, written by Pharisees; the destruction
of the Gerizim temple by Hyrcanus, also a Pharisee—all
combine to indicate that the Jewish hatred had nothing to
do with any foreign origin of the race, but was rather roused
by the religious differences of a people whom they knew to
be their own kith and kin.
</p>

<p>
If we adopt this theory the fate of the ten tribes is no
longer a mystery. As we know that before the captivity
they were addicted to strange gods and strange marriages,
it is not improbable that a large proportion lost their tribal
identity while in captivity by intermarrying with the people
by whom they were surrounded, and became merged with
them. It is also probable that a certain number, according
to the Samaritan chronicle three hundred thousand (but it
<span class="pageno target" title="355" id="page-355"></span>
need not be so large a number), returned from their captivity
at the time when the two tribes received permission from
Cyrus to return. It is also likely that others who still retained
their religion did not return, and are the ancestors of
certain Hebrew nomads still wandering in the desert. The
Jews from Yemen, for instance, assert that they are of the
tribe of Dan, while there are Jewish shepherds in Mesopotamia
whose ancestry seems not distinctly traceable to the
two tribes.
</p>

<p>
The fact that those who returned to Palestine have dwindled
numerically to so small a number is no reason why they
should not have been at one time a considerable nation, as
indeed we know they were from their subsequent history.
They made serious revolts against the Romans in the time
of Pilate, and again during the reigns of Vespasian and Severus,
but under Hadrian they assisted the Romans against
the Pharisees. In the sixth century they attacked the Christians
and put the Bishop of Nablous (or, as it was then called,
Neapolis) to death, being at that time spread over Egypt
and the whole of Palestine, except the hills of Judea. Clinging
to the unity of God, they hold Moses to be the one messenger
of God, and Gerizim to be the earth's centre, as it is
the shrine of their faith. In this they are supported by the
fact that while blessings and curses are invoked on the two
Samaritan mountains in the books of Moses, there is no mention
in those books of Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
They also believe in a state of future retribution, and of
angels and devils as ministers of God in the unseen world.
They look for a Messiah who is to be of the sons of Joseph,
and they hold that he is now on earth, though not yet declared.
His name is to begin with the letter M. His titles
are Taheb, “the restorer,” and El-Mahdi, “the guide.” Under
his direction the congregation will repair to Gerizim.
Under the famous twelve stones they will find the ten commandments,
and under the stone of Bethel the golden vessels
of the Temple and the manna. After one hundred and
ten years the Prophet, who is considered inferior to Moses,
is to die, and be buried beside Joseph, whose tomb they show
in the valley. Soon after, on the conclusion of seven thousand
years from its creation, the world is to come to an end.
</p>

<div>
<span class="pageno target" title="356" id="page-356"></span>
</div>

<p>
The Samaritans keep the Feast of the Passover on Gerizim,
near the ruins of the ancient temple; here they pitch
their tents, and at sunset they slay sheep and bake them for
several hours in a huge oven in the ground, which is lined
with stone. The men are girded with ropes, with staves in
their hands and shoes on their feet, as though prepared for
a journey. They generally eat standing or walking. After
the women have eaten, the scraps are burned and a bonfire
kindled and fed with the fat. The rest of the night is spent
in prayer, and the following day in rejoicing. Besides this,
the Feast of Tabernacles is also held on the mountain, where
they construct arbors of arbutus branches. The Feasts of
Pentecost and of Purim and the Day of Atonement are also
observed.
</p>

<p>
The mountain is very barren, rising abruptly to a height
of one thousand feet above the valley in which the town is
situated. The ruins which are to be found upon it are described
in the guide-books, so I shall only allude to what is
new in regard to them. Considerable excavation was carried
out here by Captain Anderson under the auspices of
the Palestine Exploration Fund, and plans made of what
remains of the Fortress of Justinian, which is one of the
most valuable monuments of Byzantine art in Palestine, and
of the church said to have been built by Zeno. The twelve
stones, traditionally said to have come from the Jordan,
were also excavated, and found to be large, unhewn masses
of rock placed upon two other courses of stone rudely dressed
and not squared. Some paved platforms were also laid bare.
These, together with the twelve stones, may possibly have
formed part of the temple built by Sanballat on Gerizim.
Curiously enough, there is a sacred rock here, with a cave
under it, not very unlike the rock and cave over which the
Mosque of Omar is built in the Haram at Jerusalem, and
with the same traditions attached to them. There is also a
large ruin on Mount Ebal, enclosing an area ninety-two feet
square, with walls twenty feet thick; but the excavations
which were made here were attended with no result, and
conjecture is at fault as to what it may have been.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the most interesting spots at Nablous are Jacob's
well and Joseph's tomb, but this from the point of view
<span class="pageno target" title="357" id="page-357"></span>
purely of association. Where sites which can be identified
with any certainty are so rare, these two spots stand out preeminently
as places about which there is a unanimity of
agreement and force of tradition which go far to confirm
their authenticity. They are venerated by the members of
every religious community in Palestine. Here also we may
look with almost positive certainty upon the position taken
up by the Israelites when they stood “half over against Gerizim”
and “half over against Ebal,” to listen to the reading
of the law. Great pains have also been taken to discover
the position of “the great stone” which Joshua “set up
under an oak that was by the sanctuary of the Lord” when
he made his covenant with the people in Shechem immediately
before his death, and not altogether without success.
The exactitude with which the tombs of Joshua, Eleazar,
and Phinehas are described in the sacred record enables us
to regard the ancient sepulchres which are still pointed out
as theirs with far less skepticism than usually accompanies
our notice of such memorials of the dead.
</p>

<p>
Altogether, the extreme antiquity of Shechem as a site,
and the important events of which it was the scene in the
earliest period of Jewish history, invest it with an interest
denied to every other locality in Palestine, excepting Jerusalem
itself, while the well of Jacob must ever be memorable—if,
as was most likely, it was the spot where Christ
met the woman of Samaria—for perhaps the most remarkable
of all his utterances. When we remember the religious
fanaticism which characterized both Jew and Samaritan, and
the bigoted prejudice which envenomed the inveterate hatred
they felt for each other, and which turned principally upon
the rival claims for sanctity of Jerusalem and Gerizim, it
seems almost incredible that a Jew could have been found,
and he a carpenter, gifted with such lofty courage and such
high spiritual intuition that he should dare to say: “Woman,
believe me, the hour cometh when ye shall neither on this
mountain, nor at Jerusalem, worship the Father. They that
worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.”

<a href="#toc-65">RESEARCHES IN SAMARIA.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Haifa</span>, Nov. 3.—While at Nablous I received information
that a large piece of ancient sculpture had been discovered
by a man in excavating some foundations. I procured a
guide, and proceeded to his dwelling. It was evidently the
residence of a man of means, and stood in a large courtyard,
at the entrance to which I knocked for admittance. After
hammering for some time a voice from within asked who I
was and what I wanted. On my shouting a reply, I was
abruptly told to go away, and all was silent. Now, the accounts
I had heard of this antiquity stimulated my curiosity
to such a degree that, in addition to the indignation I felt
at this treatment, my desire to see the relic overcame my
forbearance, and, seizing a stone, while I ordered my attendant
to take another, we made the quarter ring with our
blows. After a time the voice was heard again: “Why
don't you go away. I won't open the door.”
</p>

<p>
“I won't go away, and I will break open the door if you
don't open it,” I shouted.
</p>

<p>
“But I am the chief of the police.”
</p>

<p>
“I don't care who you are; open the door,” and bang went
a stone against it.
</p>

<p>
There was silence for a moment, and then another and a
milder voice: “Wait a moment. I will let you in,” and
the door opened and revealed an empty courtyard and a
youth.
</p>

<p>
“My father was angry because you disturbed him so
early,” he remarked, apologetically, and I then observed
many signs betokening a recent rapid evacuation on the part
of the female members of the family.
</p>

<p>
Now that I was in, with a large fragment of a beautifully
carved frieze staring me in the face, I could afford to be
civil. I was profuse in my apologies, and promised to disturb
<span class="pageno target" title="359" id="page-359"></span>
no one if I were only shown the antiquities. But I was
destined to experience another reaction of disappointment
when the mild youth informed me that this was all there
was left. The others had been sent to the museum at Constantinople.
Fortunately antiquities, especially when they
are massive, travel slowly in this country, and as I had an
opportunity of seeing these before they left Haifa, and made
such careful copies of them as time permitted, I will describe
them.
</p>

<p>
The peculiar interest which attaches to these remains,
which evidently belong to the Græco-Roman period, arises
from the fact that they may possibly have formed part of
the great pagan temple which is represented on the Greek
imperial coins of the ancient Acropolis. The main objection
to this theory is that the temple, it is supposed, was
erected on Mount Gerizim, and the coins show that it was
approached by a handsome flight of steps, whereas these remains
were found not far from the base of the mountain,
though sufficiently on its slope to warrant the approach of
a flight of steps. The fact that the subjects of the tableaux
are all taken from Greek mythology would indicate that
there must have been a large population in Samaria in those
days, who, so far as their worship was concerned, were not
Samaritans.
</p>

<p>
Besides two draped figures, unfortunately without their
heads, one life-size and one fifty inches in height, there was a
pedestal forty inches high, triangular in shape, and on each
face were two tableaux in bas-relief, making six carved
representations in all, in a very perfect state of preservation,
with inscriptions in Greek above them, of which, however,
I have only been able to make out the general tenor in some
cases. Besides copying the inscriptions, I made such sketches
as I was able of the tableaux. Where many figures are
crowded together this is a very difficult operation. The
first scene represents a chariot drawn by serpents, in which
is a robed female, while on the left a woman is crouched
down under a tree. The second consists of Artemis, Apollo,
and Leto, with their names inscribed above them, while on
the right is the serpent Python, his head pierced by an arrow.
The third represented an infant struggling with a
<span class="pageno target" title="360" id="page-360"></span>
serpent between two draped female figures, evidently Hercules
strangling the serpents sent against him by Hera; for
above were the words, “<i>Trophoi Erakles</i>.” These formed
the upper tableaux. Below them were three other tableaux,
illustrating the legend of Theseus, the inscription being
“<i>Theseus gnorismata</i>,” above a tableau in which he is represented
raising a stone under which are hidden the sword
and shoes of his father Aigeus. In the second he is kneeling
on one knee in a struggle with the Minotaur, while behind
him are a group of boys whom he came to save. In
the third he has slain the robber, who is lying prostrate at
his feet. Theseus is nude and leaning on his club, with three
other persons all robed standing by him.
</p>

<p>
There can be little doubt that had any one been present
when this discovery was made, a fuller excavation would
have been amply repaid, and that the house of the ill-tempered
old Moslem stands on a site of the highest interest.
I have carefully noted its position, in the hope that at some
future day conditions may exist which would render possible
an examination of his garden, which is now surrounded
by a high wall. It would require little digging to determine
whether this was the site of the celebrated temple or
not.
</p>

<p>
I now left Nablous for the purpose of visiting the ruins
of the ancient city of Samaria, distant about five miles, and
formerly the political capital of the country. It is placed
in a most commanding position, and, from a strategical
point of view, was well chosen. Nothing can exceed the
beauty of the prospect of the surrounding country which is
obtained from it. We first inspect the Crusading church of
St. John the Baptist, which must have been a beautiful edifice
in its day. The walls alone are now standing. In an
underground crypt, now held sacred by the Moslem peasantry,
the saint is supposed to have been beheaded. The
tradition, though erroneous, is ancient, and existed in 380
<span class="sc small">A.D.</span> It has some colour, from the fact that the wilderness
in which John preached is near this, and not near Jericho,
as is generally supposed. It can be pretty well identified
by the description “Onon, near to Salem,” where John was
baptizing, “because there was much water there.” Both
<span class="pageno target" title="361" id="page-361"></span>
these places retain their names, and there is an abundant
supply of water, which flows hence into the Jordan. The
fact that Bethabara must be placed much higher up the Jordan
valley than the position usually assigned to it by tradition
makes it pretty certain that the Wady Far'ah, the head
of which is near Samaria, in which are Onon and Salem,
and which flows into the Jordan not far from the probable
position of Bethabara, was the scene of John's ministrations.
</p>

<p>
The most interesting ruins, however, are those of Herod's
Colonnade, to the west of the modern village. It seems to
have run round the hill on a flat terrace, in the middle of
which rises a rounded knoll, on which the temple dedicated
to Augustus, and stated by Josephus to be in the middle of
the town, presumably stood. The remains are most perfect
on the south, where some eighty columns are standing.
These are mainly monolithic. The width of the cloister
was sixty feet, and the pillars are sixteen feet high and six
feet apart. The whole length of what must have been a
most imposing colonnade was about two thousand yards, or
nearly a mile and a quarter. Josephus makes it nearly two
miles, but this is exaggerated. There is another street of
columns at the bottom of the hill running in a line oblique
to the sides of the upper colonnade. The colonnade was
entered by a gateway, flanked by small towers, the scarps of
which still remain.
</p>

<p>
Samaria is not to be compared in antiquity with Shechem,
its most flourishing time being, probably, during the reign
of Herod, when, in fact, all Palestine enjoyed a period of
architectural magnificence greater than anything it had previously
known. If, instead of following the ordinary road
from Samaria, we ascend, from the large village of Burka, a
steep hill, we burst upon a view which is well worth the
climb, which has also the advantage of being a short cut.
We look down into a fertile basin covered with olive groves
and villages, and in the distance can see a considerable extent
of coast line near Cæsarea, while the familiar outline of
Carmel to the northwest closes the prospect. Then we
plunge down into the gardens of the village of Fendakumiyeh,
where there is a sacred cave worth visiting, containing
two recesses, before which there is a detached block of
stone like an altar. It may probably have been an ancient
rock-cut chapel. Close to this village is another called Zeba,
which I was sorely tempted to visit, as I had received an invitation
to do so from the sheik who lives here, and who is
one of the richest and most powerful sheiks in the country.
He had already called upon me in Haifa, and represents the
great family of Jerrar, who once exercised an almost independent
rule in this district, setting the Turkish government
at defiance, and levying blackmail on the inhabitants,
while they were in perpetual feud with rival families who
claimed a like local supremacy in other parts of the country.
The whole of this system was broken down during the
Egyptian occupation of the country by Ibrahim Pasha.
When, by British intervention, it was handed back to the
Turkish government, the latter succeeded in preventing its
recurrence—not, however, without the application of force.
More than one of these local sheiks can point out to you a
hole in the wall of his house which was made by a Turkish
cannon-ball. They are by degrees submitting to the influence
of civilization, and, finding that it is no longer possible
to compete successfully with the officials in plundering the
peasantry, are making friends with these latter, so as either
to go shares with them, or to obtain their favor and assistance
in their own agricultural operations, and thus avoid
being robbed themselves.
</p>

<p>
Thus in the immediate neighbourhood of this village
there is a plain called the Drowned Meadow, from the fact
that during a great part of the year it is a marsh, and
therefore unavailable for crops. Could it be drained it
would add some thousands of acres of arable land to the
village to which it belonged. Not long ago I was consulted
in regard to the possibility of its being drained, and an engineer
even went so far as to make an estimate of the probable
cost of the operation. Although the sum charged was
very moderate, it was more than the capitalists could venture
upon, but the very fact that they could entertain such
an idea was a marked evidence of progress on the part of
men whose only notion of drainage heretofore had been confined
to their neighbours' pockets.

<p>
Although probably I should have seen a splendid specimen
of a native magnate's establishment, I found that a halt
at Zeba would have lost me a day, and I therefore pushed
on without allowing the sheik to suspect my proximity to
his hospitable abode, still keeping to bypaths instead of
following the beaten track to Jenin, the ancient Engannin,
or Spring of Gardens. From thence, in a day's journey
across the plain of Esdrælon, I reached Haifa.

<a href="#toc-66">A DRUSE FATHER'S VENGEANCE.</a>
</h3>

<p>
<span class="local">Daliet-el-Carmel</span>, Nov. 7.—An incident so highly
characteristic of Druse life and manners has just occurred
here that it seems worthy of narration. About three months
ago I was invited to be present at the ceremony of the
betrothal of the son of the richest man in the village, by
name Sheik Saleh, with the daughter of a neighbour called
Kara, whose wife was a sister of Sheik Saleh. The affair
came off in the house of the former, a small mud-built cottage
situated in a court, with the usual arched roof, and floor
of a rough kind of cement, on which were spread rugs and
mats for the guests who crowded in to witness the ceremony.
This took place at nine o'clock at night, and was performed
by the khateeb, or spiritual sheik. It consisted in his joining
the hands of the future bridegroom and bride's father—the
bride herself was not present—and in his repeating several
formulas in Arabic, among which I detected some of the
verses of the Koran. A small sum of money was then paid
over to the family of the bride, the khateeb took his fee
out of it, refreshments were brought in, and the rite was
over.
</p>

<p>
It was a relatively tame performance, and not to be compared
with an actual wedding of another couple which took
place shortly afterwards, when the festivities lasted three
days and nights, during which time the bride, loaded with
her dowry, which consisted chiefly of silver coins formed
into a head-dress and breastplate, danced incessantly in the
centre of admiring circles of girls who danced round her,
while the men were also making the night resound with their
discordant clamour to the utter destruction of slumber, firing
off guns, making bonfires, and singing. In fact, at the end
of the three days the whole village, but especially the bride,
were utterly exhausted by their protracted gaieties. At
<span class="pageno target" title="365" id="page-365"></span>
the end of this time she was put upon a horse and marched
in solemn procession to the door of every house in the village,
followed by a bevy of damsels screaming and clapping their
hands. Each house was expected to contribute a small sum—make
a wedding-present, in fact, to the newly-married
couple. In this way she was finally conducted to the bridegroom's
house, where he was waiting for her with a capacious
mantle, in which, on her arrival, he enveloped her, and then
carried her into his house triumphant.
</p>

<p>
To go back to the episode of the betrothal. It is the Druse
custom for the father of the bridegroom to pay a sum of
money to the bride's family—in other words, he buys his son
a wife. Now, in this case, although I saw some money pass
on the occasion, it was a mere formality. The father of the
bride had, in a fit of generosity, probably interested, refused
a sum of 2000 piastres, or about $75 for his daughter. He
proposed instead that he should form a partnership for
agricultural operations with Sheik Saleh, who, being rich,
would be an advantageous partner. This Sheik Saleh
agreed to, and the arrangement was completed, when it was
objected to by Sheik Saleh's wife, who, being a woman of
character and resolution, induced her husband to break it
off. This made Kara furious. He is a man of ungovernable
temper, and he determined that his daughter should never
wed Sheik Saleh's son. But a betrothal of the kind I had
witnessed is a very solemn ceremony, and the only person
who can break it is the betrothed bridegroom. The girl and
her family are powerless in the matter. Kara was so maddened
by what had occurred that, rather than let his daughter
marry the son of the man by whom he felt himself to
have been outraged, he determined to kill her. This was an
odd resolution to arrive at. One would have thought he
might have gratified his vengeance better by killing Sheik
Saleh or his son. Druse passion, however, runs in curious
channels, and he appears to have been exasperated because
his daughter did not share in his fury against her cousin.
</p>

<p>
So he led her out to slaughter, riding his horse and armed
with his gun, and driving the poor girl, who was weeping
and wailing bitterly, before him. Many of the villagers saw
him, and were well aware of his intention, but shrank from
<span class="pageno target" title="366" id="page-366"></span>
interfering. The place which he had selected for the execution
was just at the bottom of the hill upon which my
house is situated, and the hour at which he was bent upon
this bloody errand was eight in the evening. Now, it so
happened that I have a Druse servant who has been with me
for more than a year, a powerful man, a splendid sportsman,
a most courageous fellow, and, what perhaps was of more
importance, a near relation of Kara's. He chanced to be
passing at the time, and knowing his relative's furious temper,
and perceiving that he really intended to murder his
daughter, he interfered at the risk of his own life, and succeeded
in rescuing the girl. Kara, however, was still too
angry to be reasonable. He returned to his house foaming
with passion, and finding his wife—who had lived with him
for many years—weeping bitterly over the whole occurrence,
he accused her of sympathy with her brother's family, and
in the heat of the moment pronounced the fatal words
which, according to Druse custom, constitute a divorce.
</p>

<p>
The trouble about a Druse divorce is, that the sentence
which bids a woman return to her family, once pronounced
by her husband, is irrevocable. Not only can he never take
her back again as his wife, but he can never, in this life, so
much as even speak to her again. If he sees her at the
other end of the street he must turn away to avoid meeting
her. Nor may he enter a house in which he has reason to
think that she is. A man may, therefore, in a moment of
passion ruin his own happiness for life, and this is what Kara
did. The whole occurrence only happened two days ago,
and Kara has been in the deepest distress ever since. Had
he killed his daughter, he said, it would not have mattered.
He would scarcely have missed her, and if she were
to marry Sheik Saleh's son she would be dead to him any
way; but to be deprived of a wife, against whom he had
never had a complaint to make, who had loved him and
served him faithfully all these years—this was a loss that
nothing could replace.
</p>

<p>
When I heard that he had spoken in this cold-blooded way
about his daughter, and had alluded to the intention, which
he admitted he had entertained, of killing her, without a
shadow of compunction, I half regretted that he had not
<span class="pageno target" title="367" id="page-367"></span>
been allowed to die the other day of a leech which he had
in his throat. He sent word that he was dying, and a medical
friend who is staying with me went to see him, and
found him in the last stages of exhaustion from a leech
which had been sixteen days fastened too far down his throat
to be liberated. These cases are not uncommon, and are due
to the water of some of the springs in the neighbourhood.
We have had five cases this year, but none so bad as Kara's,
which was the first. Salt and all the usual means were tried
in vain, and, as the doctor was anxious to get some leeches
to experiment with, Kara's wife and daughter, who both exhibited
the greatest distress, were despatched to a spring
three miles off to get them. The alacrity they displayed
in his service were ill requited by his subsequent conduct
towards them. Here I may remark that large doses of turpentine,
taken internally, proved completely successful.
There is little doubt that, had the leech not succumbed to
this treatment, in two days more Kara must have succumbed
to the leech.
</p>

<p>
The daring with which Druses resort to acts of violence
is to be accounted for by the fact that they can always
escape justice. The moment a Druse commits a crime he
flies to the Hauran, which he can reach with hard travel in
eight-and-forty hours. Here he takes refuge among his
coreligionaries of the Jebel Druse Mountain, over whom the
Turkish government exercises only a nominal authority, and
where pursuit is impossible for any Ottoman official.
</p>

<p>
Meantime there is to be a great gathering of the village
elders to consider whether it is possible to arrange the feud
between Sheik Saleh and Kara. One of the uses to which
Druse Khalwès, or places of worship, is put, is to discuss
every question which is of interest to the village. For instance,
should I desire to buy a tract of land from the village
held by many proprietors, they would hold a secret
council in the Khalwè to discuss the best method of cheating
me. What passes at these meetings is considered absolutely
secret, and the minority are bound to accept the
opinion of the majority, and afterwards to act with it. This
imparts a wonderful unanimity to all their proceedings with
outsiders, though they quarrel very much among themselves,
<span class="pageno target" title="368" id="page-368"></span>
and these Khalwè meetings sometimes lead to serious feuds
and bloodshed. It seems likely to do so in this case, for it
has been reported to me that Kara announced that if the
decision of the meeting went against him, he would commit
such an act as should prevent it—in other words, murder
either his own daughter or her betrothed.
</p>

<p>
I was considering how I could best interfere to prevent
such a catastrophe, when I received a few hours ago a visit
from Kara himself. The purport of it, as usual, was to
borrow money. I told him I could not possibly lend money
to a man who first decided to kill his own daughter, and
then for no cause divorced his wife. He replied that when
he had committed these acts he was possessed of the devil
and unconscious of what he was doing. I told him that to
lend money to a man who was subject to such demoniac
possession was like lending money to the devil himself,
and this I declined to do. He assured me that the devil
had left him so completely that there was no fear of his
getting hold of it. I said I required proof of this, and he
could furnish me with it by assuring me of his readiness to
allow his daughter to marry her betrothed. He said that
was a matter in the hands of Allah. “Then,” I said,
“under these circumstances you are prepared, I presume,
to accept the decision of the village as the decision of
Allah.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes,” he replied, “if they decide also that Sheik Saleh is
to pay me fifty Turkish pounds for my daughter.”
</p>

<p>
“I am sorry,” I remarked, “that Allah has just decided
that I am not to lend you the money you want to borrow
from me, and it will depend entirely upon the extent to which
you allow the devil to influence you against the will of Allah
how I treat you for the future.”
</p>

<p>
With that he took his departure; but I saw enough of
his cowed temper for the present to hope that the matter
may be arranged with a little judicious financial management.
It does not give an encouraging view of human
nature to discover how potent a factor money is in its affairs,
even in a primitive Druse village.
</p>

<p>
In many respects Kara is a superior man, decidedly better
than his enemy, Sheik Saleh, who will also have to be
<span class="pageno target" title="369" id="page-369"></span>
dealt with, and who behaved badly in backing out of an
arrangement which had already been concluded, for no
valid reason. Owing, however, to the position which I occupy
financially to the village, they are all more or less under
control, and I have it in my power to exercise a pressure
which even the Khalwè would find it difficult to resist.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, I shall be obliged to leave instructions with
regard to this delicate matter, as my stay in Palestine for
the present is about to draw to a close, and with it must
terminate this record of my experiences in a country which,
in spite of its many drawbacks, possesses in my eyes superior
attractions as a residence to any other in which my lot has
been cast.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
